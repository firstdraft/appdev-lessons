# Application Development Lessons

This repository was originally pulled from the [appdev-textbook](https://github.com/firstdraft/appdev-textbook) repository, which was being written in bookdown. That repository in turn was largely based on the [appdev-chapters](https://github.com/firstdraft/appdev-chapters) repo. 

This repository is a place to rewrite any bookdown chapters from the "textbook" into the format required for "lessons".
