# Application Development Textbook

This repository will hold the outline for a textbook written with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/). Some notes about using bookdown can be found [here](https://www.bendirt.com/bookdown/).

The site is deployed at [https://www.bendirt.com/appdev-textbook/](https://www.bendirt.com/appdev-textbook/) from the `docs/` folder, which was generated locally with the R command `bookdown::render_book()`.
