## What's missing?

Running list of things TODO:

  - The location(s) of the technical references ("TechRef"), and how they are built up

  - Command-line basics
    - could just be a short "Tutorial" video along with a "TechRef" of all the commands shown in the course
    - place to explain directory structure and filepaths

  - Dedicated video + text content of technical setup. Gitpod and github accounts, opening gitpod workspace, tab organization, /git commiting, rails grade, etc. Can be done with "RPS HTML" or "String" as example. **See "Gitpod Technical Setup" topic in "Week 1" below.**

  - Dedicated video + text content of gems and Gemfile (and maybe `bundle`). This is found throughout content right now.

  - CSS reference, there is some here: `classbook.md`

  - Text doc with "keyboard magic" commands (e.g., TAB completion, opening/clearing terminal). 

  - Dedicated video + text for ideas.firstdraft.com with domain model for OfferUp. **See Week 6" topic "Domain Modeling"**

  - Video tutorial for https://association-accessors.firstdraft.com/. This is in the last 10 minutes of Day 7 recording right now. Maybe a dedicated chapter for `belongs_to`, `has_many`, `scope`, `through`, and use of `.joins()` for queries.

  - Dedicated video + text content for starting from scratch, generator resources, and migration. This is spread across videos (e.g., Day 7 video, Day 8 short video, Photogram and MSM signin), chapters (e.g., `active-record.md`, `draft-generators.md`, `draft-account.md`), classroom examples (Day 8 recordings). **See "Week 8" topic "Starting from Scratch with Generators" below.**

  - API videos for Mailgun, Twilio, etc. 

  - Print stylesheet applied to any lesson to make hard copies (pdf)

  - Heroku alternative video / writeup
