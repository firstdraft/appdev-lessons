# CSS for JS by Josh Comeau

- start with anatomy of CSS style rules 
    - selector > rule > declaration > property > value > unit

- @media queries because different screen sizes are very important
    - provides a nice intro to conditionals!
        ```css
        @media (condition) {
        /* Some CSS that'll run if the condition is met. */
        }
        ```
