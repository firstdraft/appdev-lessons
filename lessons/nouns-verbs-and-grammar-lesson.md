## Nouns, verbs, and grammar

### You already know how to program

Programming is the art of getting a computer to do useful things with information.

If you think about it that way, then you already know at least one programming language:

<!-- ![](assets/nouns-verbs-and-grammar/youalreadyknow.png) -->
![file](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmxgp9oq2/image/upload/v1676403771/youalreadyknow_s6uitc.png)

In the case of a calculator, the "information" is numbers and the "useful things" are adding, subtracting, multiplying, etc. Like any computer (or person), we get the calculator to do useful work by writing instructions that it can understand.

For example, if we press the keys <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>√ó</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd> <kbd>=</kbd> (in that order), then the calculator will return `42` on the screen; but if we press the keys <kbd>√ó</kbd> <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>=</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd>, then it won't.

- In the above example, `7` and `6` are known as **data**, or as I think of it, _nouns_.
- `x` and `=` are known as **methods**, or as I think of it, _verbs_.
- The order in which we press the keys is known as **syntax**, or as I think of it, _grammar_.
- Altogether, some data and some methods put together using correct syntax form an **expression**, or as I think of it, a _sentence_.
- Given a valid expression, the computer will process it and **return** a piece of useful data back to us.

A basic calculator's entire vocabulary consists of the following:

**Data**

<kbd>1</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd> <kbd>4</kbd> <kbd>5</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd> <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>8</kbd> <kbd>9</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd> <kbd>.</kbd>

**Methods**

<kbd>=</kbd> <kbd>+</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd> <kbd>√ó</kbd> <kbd>√∑</kbd> <kbd>%</kbd> <kbd>¬±</kbd> <kbd>AC</kbd>

**Syntax**

There are only a few rules:

- **Primary syntax**: A number, then an operator, then another number, then the <kbd>=</kbd>.
- Numbers can contain a single decimal point.
- Numbers can be modified by the plus/minus sign.
- Numbers can be modified by the percentage sign.
- Can press <kbd>AC</kbd> to reset.

It's a very small language, but it demonstrates the same parts as any other programming language: **data**, **methods**, and **syntax**.

Got it? Good, because that's basically all that there is to any other programming language, too! It's just that its vocabulary will be bigger, and it will have more grammar rules.

#### Quiz Question

- In a general sense, how can we think about the building blocks for a programming language?
- Numbers are nouns and actions are verbs. Grammar is important for some operations.
    - Not quite, grammar is very important always, and can you be more specific than "actions"
- Numbers or text are data and we do math on them based on some grammatical rules
    - That's only partially right, but we can have more types of data and we're not just limited to classic math
- Any data can be a noun, methods that we apply to the data are verbs, the syntax defines the grammatical rules
    - Yes!

### Ruby's vocabulary

Let's start learning your second programming language ‚Äî Ruby! As we now know, that means we need to familiarize ourselves with Ruby's **data**, **methods**, and the **syntax** for putting them together.

First of all, Ruby can work with many more kinds of data than just numbers. That's what makes it much more powerful than the calculator language. Ruby has:

- Numbers
- Text
- Dates
- Times
- True/false
- Lists containing multiple pieces of data
- And a lot more

Each kind, or **class**, of data has its own set of **methods** that it can perform. For example:

- Numbers can do the usual things ‚Äî¬†add, subtract, multiply, etc.
- Two dates can tell you how far apart they are from one another.
- Lists can tell how you long they are, or sort themselves.

Ruby is known as a "batteries included" language because it comes with _so many_ methods out-of-the-box, saving the programmer the trouble of having to re-invent the wheel.

Finally, *we can even make up our own nouns and verbs* and add them to the language. For example, we can create a data type `Venue`, give it a method that calculates the average rating from its reviews, and then use that method whenever we want.

One of the best things about Ruby is its wonderful **open-source** community: programmers very often share these new classes that they write with one another, making the language ever easier to use and ever more powerful.

### Ruby's primary syntax

So, in terms of **data** and **methods**, Ruby comes with a powerful set out-of-the-box *and* is always getting better. That's good news! Here's even more good news: to access all of this power, the **primary syntax** is straightforward. It looks like this: `some_object.some_method`

Here's a real example:

```ruby
"Hello, world!".upcase
```

  In the black window that appears on the right side under the `>_ Console` tab (see margin note, this is a **terminal**), type:

  ```bash
  irb
  ```

  and press <kbd>return</kbd>. This will launch _interactive Ruby_ (IRB), a program that lets you evaluate one Ruby expression at a time.

  At the `irb(main)` prompt that appears, you can now try out `"Hello, world!".upcase`:

  <!-- ![](assets/nouns-verbs-and-grammar/irb-new.png) -->

</div>

<aside markdown="1">
The `>_ Console` tab is a "command-line" or "terminal". You enter text commands here by typing them out *exactly*, and the computer will execute them, similar to how you click on a program with your mouse to run it. You've already seen another terminal in your Gitpod workspaces for running commands like `bin/server` and `rails grade`.
</aside>

If all went well, you should have seen `=> "HELLO, WORLD!"` output by the command. Yay! What just happened?

<aside markdown="1">
It is [a time-honored tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program){:target="_blank"} that the very first thing a programmer does in a new language is print out "Hello, World!" Congratulations ‚Äî you're now one of us üôåüèæ
</aside>

The primary way to write an expression in Ruby is: `object.method`. We ask the _thing_, or noun, on the left side of the dot to perform the _action_, or the verb, on the right side of the dot.

The computer then evaluates that expression and **returns** a new piece of data in its place (just like with the calculator).

In this case, we asked `"Hello, world!"`, which is a string (Ruby's name for a piece of text), to `upcase` itself, which it (very) happily does, and we're left with `"HELLO, WORLD!"` at the end of the day.

<aside markdown="1">
The name "string" is used in pretty much every programming language for the datatype that holds a piece of text, and refers to a string of _characters_; a holdover from back when we used to have to worry about conserving the computer's physical storage space and had a separate datatype for an individual character. Now we usually don't have to worry about storage space anymore, but the name "string" stuck with us.

#### Quiz Question

- From our first program, in the framework of nouns, verbs, and grammar...
- `"Hello, world!"` is the grammar, `upcase` is the noun, and `.` is the verb
    - Not quite, try looking through the previous sections again.
- `"Hello, world!"` is the verb, `upcase` is the grammar, and `.` is the noun
    - Not quite, try looking through the previous sections again.
- `"Hello, world!"` is the noun, `upcase` is the verb, and `noun.verb` is the grammar
    - Yes! And remember noun = data; verb = method; and grammar = syntax.
- There is only a double verb syntax, with no data in our program.
    - Not quite, try looking through the previous sections again.

### Every class has different methods

Different **classes** (string being one) can perform different **methods**. Here are a few expressions to try out. Type each one into IRB.

<aside markdown="1">
Almost everything in Ruby is an **object**. That's the idea behind [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming){:target="_blank"}. Text like `"Hello, world!"` is an object ‚Äî specifically a **string class object**.
</aside>

```ruby
7.odd?
7.even?
"Mississippi".length
"Raghu Betina".reverse
"Your Name".swapcase
```

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  [Click here for a REPL to try it.](https://repl.it/@raghubetina/different-classes-have-different-methods){:target="_blank"}
</div>

What do you expect will happen if we ask `"Mississippi"` if it is `even?`? Try it:

```ruby
"Mississippi".even?
```

----

#### Quiz Question

- `"Mississippi".even?` returned...
- true
    - Really? Did you try it?
- false
    - Really? Did you try it?
- nothing
    - Really? Did you try it?
- a long message
    - Sweet, you got your first error message!
{: .choose_best #first_rtem points="10" answer="4" }

### Error Messages

#### _Do_, or do not. There is no  _read_. 

When you saw the üß™ exercise prompt, were you typing out every expression in a REPL? 

If not, then you're doing this wrong. If you're just _reading_, you won't be successful at learning programming; you have to _do_ in order to build up some muscle memory. _Practice is crucial._

In fact, not only should you be typing the things I ask you to type, but you should also be trying out random other things that occur to you. (E.g., "What if I tried `"Mississippi".length.even?`")

_Experiment!_

#### Read. The. Error. Message. (A.k.a., "RTEM") 

Aha! If you were typing out every expression and running it, then

```ruby
"Mississippi".even?
```

should have produced your very first error message! üéâ

Error messages can look scary, but **one of the most important skills you have to develop** when learning to program **is to not panic** when you see them. Slow down, **read the error message**, and see if you can make any sense of it at all. Over time, you will find that they are _very_ helpful (and you will miss them if something goes wrong silently).

So, what do you think

```bash
undefined method `even?' for "Mississippi":String
```

might mean?

In this case, it is saying: "Hey, friend ‚Äî there's no method called `even?` for `"Mississippi"`, which is a `String`. Sorry." Fair enough, that makes sense.

----

#### Quiz Question

- `"Mississippi".length.even?` returned...
- true
    - Really? Did you try it?
- false
    - Yes it did!
- nothing
    - Really? Did you try it?
- a long message
    - Really? Did you try it?

#### The bottom line 

The bottom line is ‚Äî at all times as you are writing Ruby, you should be thinking: "What **class** is this object? What **methods** does _this_ class have available?" Then, the syntax itself is simple ‚Äî `my_object.cool_method`.

### Arguments are inputs

Alright, so the **primary syntax** in Ruby is straightforward ‚Äî `object.method`. However, there's a wrinkle: some methods require additional inputs. For example, there is a method called `gsub` which we can call on a `String`, which will substitute characters with other characters. Try it:

```ruby
"Java is a joy".gsub("Java", "Ruby")
```

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  [Click here for a REPL to try it.](https://repl.it/@raghubetina/arguments-are-inputs){:target="_blank"}
</div>

`gsub` is short for "globally substitute", because it will replace _all_ occurrences of one _substring_ with another _substring_.

In order to do its job, the `gsub` method needs to know what substring to get rid of and what to replace it with. So we give it inputs, or **arguments**, which must come in parentheses _immediately_ following the method. If the method takes multiple arguments, as `gsub` does, then they are separated by commas.

<aside markdown="1">
We often use the terms **parameters** and **arguments** interchangably, but there [is a slight difference](https://www.alchemists.io/articles/ruby_method_parameters_and_arguments/){:target="_blank"}.
</aside>

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  Try replacing `"Java is a joy"` with any string you like, and experiment with different arguments instead of `"Java"` and `"Ruby"`. For example, use `gsub` to change `"Hello, world!"` to say `"Hello, you there!"`. Then, start with `"resume"` and try to transform it into `"r√©sum√©"`. What is the purpose of `gsub`'s first argument, and what is the purpose of the second argument?
</div>

In reality, `gsub` is more often used to do things like removing illegal characters from usernames before saving, e.g.:

```ruby
"Raghu@Bet@ina".gsub("@", "")
```

(`""` is an empty string, so all `@`s will be replaced with nothing, i.e. removed.)

### One of the only times when whitespace matters

Unlike some other languages (e.g. Python) where indentation and spacing can change the entire meaning of a program, Ruby is, generally, very permissive about how you use whitespace. You can _usually_ use spacing according to your own taste, and Ruby will be able to make sense of your code.

So, for example, whether you have spaces between arguments doesn't matter; these two are equivalent:

```ruby
"Raghu@Bet@ina".gsub("@",    "")
"Raghu@Bet@ina".gsub("@","")
```

(The most common _style_ is to have one space after each comma.)

However, one situation in which whitespace _does_ matter has to do with the **parentheses** around arguments:

```ruby
"Raghu@Bet@ina".gsub("@", "") # good
"Raghu@Bet@ina".gsub ("@", "") # bad!
```

Can you spot the difference? **Don't put a space between the method and the opening parenthesis.**

It's a very easy mistake to make, so I just wanted to warn you early on so that you can begin developing good muscle memory. Try the bad version in your sandbox and see what the error message looks like:

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  [Click here for a REPL to try it.](https://replit.com/@raghubetina/bad-argument-syntax){:target="_blank"}
</div>

### Seriously: please read the error message

Programming boils down to:

 1. Forming a plan of what you want to do (e.g. "I want to remove any `@`s in this input.")
 1. Typing some code to try and do it.
 1. It _never_ works the first time.
 1. Seeing an error message.
 1. Learning how to deal with that particular error message.
 1. The next time you encounter that error message, it will be vaguely familiar and it will take slightly less time to debug it.
 1. After you've encountered that error message for the 25th time, you will debug it instantly.

Your skill level as a programmer is essentially **the number of error messages that you have encountered in the past and now recognize**. So start paying attention to them now ‚Äî¬†we want to collect 'em all!

---

#### Quiz Question

- What do you call the things we put inside of the parentheses after a method?
- arguments
    - Yes! 
- variables
    - Sure, they can be variables, but what kind specifically when they are inside the `()` after a method?
{: .free_text #arguments points="10" answer="1" }

### An aside: Code comments

Here's a debate that will rage until the end of time: what do you call this symbol?

```
                 #
```

Is it a number sign? Is it a pound sign? Is it a hashtag? Is it a waffle?

In this text, I'm going to refer to it as an [octothorpe](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/octothorpe){:target="_blank"}.

The octothorpe is used quite a bit in Ruby. You can see one important way in the example above, where I said `# bad!` after some offending code. That is known as a "code comment". The Ruby interpreter, when it sees the `#`, will ignore it and everything that comes after it; allowing us to leave notes to ourselves and to each other. **Use comments liberally.**

<aside markdown="1">

Comments in Ruby are done with `#`. But in HTML files, they are done like: `<!-- comment here -->`, and in CSS files they are done like: `/* comment here */`. Just something to keep in mind. Luckily the keyboard combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> will add a comment automatically in whatever format the file is in.
</aside>

Another nice trick is: when experimenting with some code and it's not working, just comment it out and try a different approach on the next line. That way you can keep the old code around for reference without having to delete it, but it won't break the program:

```ruby
# "Raghu@Bet@ina".gsub ("@", "")

# The code above was throwing an error message,
# but I want to save it for reference as I try
# to debug, so I put a #-symbol before it. 
# Now, let me see if this thing below fixes it

"Raghu@Bet@ina".gsub("@", "")
```

### Variables are boxes

Now that you've seen **arguments**, you know all there is to know about crafting _expressions_ in Ruby. No kidding: `object.method(arguments)` is the *vast* majority of what we'll be doing. That's it.

However, so far we haven't been doing much with the **return value** of each expression. We've just been reading it off the screen, and then dropping it on the ground. For example, try the following:

```ruby
# "hello world".upcase
# "hello world".reverse
```

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  [Click here for a REPL to try it.](https://repl.it/@raghubetina/variables-drop-on-the-ground){:target="_blank"} Did it work? Did you copy-paste and forget to remove the leading `#` symbol..?
</div>

We're not really able to make any forward progress when we only perform one operation at a time. Programs get interesting only when we start to take the return value of one expression and feed it into the _next_ method. That's how we craft our own novel, useful applications from the basic building blocks of Ruby.

So: let's start to store our return values for future reference, instead of dropping them on the ground. We do this using **variables**, or as I like to think of them, _boxes_. Let's get our feet wet:

Type the following:

```ruby
s = "hello world!".upcase
s
```

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  [Click here for a REPL to try it.](https://repl.it/@raghubetina/variables-are-boxes){:target="_blank"} (Keep this REPL open when you are done, we'll use it in the next few steps.)
</div>

This creates a box, labels it `s`, and stores the string `"HELLO WORLD!"` in it.

#### The variable assignment operator 

The single equals sign, `=`, is called the **variable assignment operator**.

When I read

```ruby
s = "hello world!".upcase
```

out loud, I say "the string hello world dot upcase _is assigned_ to the variable s". I read the right side first, because that's how Ruby reads it too; it first evaluates the expression on the right side of the `=`, and then it stores the resulting value in the variable on the left.

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  Now add another line to the previous REPL,

  ```ruby
  s = "hello world!".upcase
  s.reverse
  s
  ```

  And keep this REPL open, since we'll be using it below.
</div>

Great! Now we're making progress.

#### Storing the next return value 

What would you expect to happen if you add a third line so that your program reads:

```ruby
s = "hello world!".upcase
s.reverse
s.gsub("L", "Z")
```

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  Do it! Type the above code into your current REPL.
</div>

What do you think `s` contains now? Try it:

```ruby
s
```

Did it match your expectations?

Most Ruby methods don't modify the object that they are called upon; they just return a **modified copy**. The original variable is untouched, so if we want to hold on to the new value then we better store that too. Type this:

```ruby
s = "hello world!".upcase
t = s.reverse
u = t.gsub("L", "Z")
u
```

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  Do it! Type the above code into your current REPL.
</div>

Fortunately, we can create as many variables as we want.

----

#### Quiz Question

- In the previous example, what did the variable `t` contain?
- !DLROW OLLEH
    - Yes! 
- hello world!
    - Nope, please run the code to see.
{: .free_text #storing_returns points="10" answer="1" }

----

#### Updating variables 

It can get old coming up with different variable names for every step of the program. Instead, we usually want to re-use existing variables. We can throw away what we have in the box and put in something entirely different with the same assignment operator, `=`. Type this:

```ruby
s = "hi"
s = 2.odd?
s
```

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  Do it! Type the above code into your current REPL.
</div>

We can even replace the value in the box with an updated version of the _old_ value, because _the expression on the right side of the assignment operator is evaluated before the assignment takes place_. Type this:

```ruby
s = "hello, world!"
s = s.capitalize
s = s.reverse
s
```

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  Do it! Type the above code into your current REPL.
</div>

That may look strange ‚Äî how can we use `s` on the left side _and_ the right side of the `=`?

But it's because this is _not the equals sign from math class_; this is the **variable assignment operator**, and the right side is evaluated first until only a single value is left; and _then_ that object is assigned into the box on the left (replacing whatever was there before).

So you will very often see something like this:

```ruby
counter = counter + 1
```

When we're keeping track of e.g. how many times we've printed something out on the screen. We are taking the original value of `counter`, adding `1` to it, and then replacing the contents of `counter` with that new total.

#### Variable syntax 

You may have noticed that the variable assignment syntax is a departure from the primary syntax of `object.method`. But we do it all day long, so we need to know it just as well. Our programs will end up looking like this (these are made-up method names, so this code won't work):

```ruby
storage_box_1 = "starting data".first_transformation
storage_box_2 = storage_box_1.second_step
storage_box_3 = storage_box_2.third_method.maybe_even("another", "one")
# etc for dozens or hundreds of lines
```

*First*, the expression on the right side of the assignment operator will be evaluated until there are no methods left and there's just a piece of data remaining.

*Then*, that value will be placed in the variable named on the left side of the assignment operator, which will be created if it doesn't exist, or will have its value replaced if it does exist.

Most programs are just a long succession of statements where we do some work with `object.method` and store the result in some variable, then we do some more work on that variable and store the result in yet another variable, and a hundred steps later we've produced our final result and we display that to our user.

----

#### Quiz Question

- The `=` character in Ruby is...
- called the variable assignment operator.
    - Yes! 
- works the same as the classic `=` sign from math class.
    - Nope, please reread the previous sections.
- used to store objects (e.g., data) in variables.
    - Yes!
- can have the same variable on the left and right side.
    - Yes!
- can only have one operation on the right side.
    - Nope, please reread the previous sections.
{: .choose_all #assignment points="10" answer="[1,3,4]" }

----

#### Variable naming rules 

When you are choosing your variable names, there are some rules:

- Variable names can only contain **lowercase** letters (`a..z`), numbers (`0..9`), and underscores (`_`) ‚Äî¬†they can't contain spaces.
- Variable names cannot begin with a number.
- Rubyists strive to choose **descriptive** variable names, no matter how long they are, so that it's obvious to teammates what the contents are at a glance.

_Please_ avoid naming your variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Use underscores to separate words in multi-word variable names, since we can't use spaces.

### That's it

That's it for the fundamental grammar of Ruby!

```ruby
storage_box = noun.verb(input1, input2)
```

It's not _that_ much worse than the calculator language, is it? Of course, there's a bit more syntax (like how to define our own nouns and verbs) that we need to learn, but for the most part, `object.method` is the bulk of what we do.

Now we need to spend some time expanding our _vocabulary_ ‚Äî¬†what are the most commonly used data types in Ruby, and what are some of their methods? That's coming up next.
