# Domain Modeling

## Data model for OfferUp

**BENP: this is Copy-Paste from Canvas**

Explore this target application: [OfferUp](https://ddd-offer-up.herokuapp.com/){target="_blank"}

It's a simplified version of the *real* [OfferUp](https://offerup.com/){target="_blank"} -- a two-sided market. Users can:

  - post items to sell
  - browse items to purchase
  - chat with sellers to make offers
  - sellers can mark items as sold once satisfied
  - buyers and sellers coordinate meeting up on their own

Sign up for a new account in our version of Offer Up or use our standard (alice/bob/carol@example.com with password of password). Explore and experiment with the features.

Then: **design a data model that can support all user actions that you observe in app**. I.e., a complete listing of tables and columns.

  - Some old slide decks that might be handy to refer to:

    - [ERD & Ideas](https://firstdraft.slides.com/raghubetina/erd-and-ideas?token=B9Lja2V8){target="_blank"}
  
    - [Records & Relationships](https://firstdraft.slides.com/raghubetina/records-and-relationships?token=hKsM-8iq){target="_blank"}
  
  - Remember that it's usually helpful to create your tables on paper or in a spreadsheet and entering some sample records to make sure you can record everything you're trying to record, *before* attempting to create the compact Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

Finally, draw an ERD of your schema design in [firstdraft.com](https://firstdraft.com/){target="_blank"}. You can refer to the [written documentation](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/41147/pages/firstdraft-ideas-erd-tool){target="_blank"} on how to use firstdraft.com.
