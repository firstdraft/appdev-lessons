## Ruby Gym Part 2

**BENP: right after conditionals**

Before we go on, let's stop, take a breath, and try to put what we've learned so far to good use. The idea with the following exercises is to use the building blocks from the previous sections to write some small programs. These are longer projects than the exercises we've seen so far, and they may require a few different tools to complete. There is no right answer, and there are likely a few ways to solve an exercise. Just get the code to pass all of the `rails grade` tests and you are good to move on.

##### Continue the GitPod Project
