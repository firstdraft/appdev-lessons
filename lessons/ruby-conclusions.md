## Ruby Conclusions

That's it for our crash course! Congratulations, you're ready to begin using Ruby in your web applications to develop the backend code.

### Our Technical Reference vs. Google-Fu

Much of what we covered in the previous sections is collected in the [Ruby technical reference][The One Ruby Reference]. This is intended to be a quick reference of the classes and methods, and includes many things yet to come in the course. Nevertheless, it's very handy to keep open.

At this point we have all the **building blocks**:

  - **Expressions**: object.method(argument) # => returns a value
  - **Variables** to save the results of expressions.
  - **Conditionals** (If statements).
  - **Loops**.

That's all we _need_. We can build anything with these, using just some careful thought and the [technical reference][The One Ruby Reference].

#### We are inventors {-}

When you signed up to learn how to program, you signed up to _become an inventor_.

Software **developers**, by definitions, tackle unsolved problems. There aren't predefined solutions to look up and apply. Otherwise, we'd just buy something off the shelf and be software **users**. (Much cheaper, if a solution to your problem already exists.)

When faced with a task, your first instinct should be: "How can I solve this puzzle with the tools I have?"

Your first instinct _shouldn't_ be: "Let me Google for a solution to this problem." Developers do a lot of that, of course, but only after we've tried to solve it with what we already have.

"Google Fu" is a hugely important skill to practice in software development, but in this course you should resist Googling. The answers you find  are not suitable for beginners; they will more than likely slow you down.

Any assigned task _will_ be achievable using the classes, methods, and keywords introduced in the Ruby Chapters. Your job is to invent a combination of them that gets the job done.


#### Addendum: Optional Ruby Practice {-}

If this is your first time programming, then it's a lot of new concepts to absorb! Sometimes hearing the same concepts in different words helps. Here are some other optional resources you can go through at your leisure if you'd like more Ruby practice:

  - Treehouse's [Ruby Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-basics-2){target="_blank"}

Other than the introduction to Ruby that I’ve written specifically for our purposes, Treehouse's is the one I like best.

If you would like even more practice before we get to our own introduction to Ruby, then there’s also:

  - CodeCademy's [Learn Ruby track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby){target="_blank"}, up to and including Part 4 (Arrays and Hashes). (After Part 4, they touch on quite a few concepts that we won’t use much during AppDev, but are useful in the long run if you continue with Ruby.)

Both Treehouse and CodeCademy have an in-browser programming environment, so it's easy to just start learning right away (no installing of things on your laptop required).

However, be warned that both Treehouse and CodeCademy mention some language features of Ruby that I deliberately cut out in order to keep our learning load as slim as possible. It's not necessarily bad to see them, but we won't be using them in class.
