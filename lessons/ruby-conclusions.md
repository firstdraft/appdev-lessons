## Ruby Conclusions

That's it for our crash course! Congratulations, you're ready to begin using Ruby in your web applications to develop the backend code.

### Our Technical Reference vs. Google-Fu

Much of what we covered in the previous sections is collected in the first part of [The One Ruby Reference](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33){:target="_blank"}. This is intended to be a quick reference of the Classes and methods you have seen so far. There are also references to [some more Ruby methods](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/21){:target="_blank"} that will help you in the upcoming gym exercise below.

At this point we have all the **building blocks**:

  - **Expressions**: `object.method(argument) # => returns a value`
  - **Variables** to save the results of expressions.
  - **Conditionals** (If statements).
  - **Loops**.

That's all we _need_. We can build anything with these, using just some careful thought.

#### We are inventors 

When you signed up to learn how to program, you signed up to _become an inventor_.

Software **developers**, by definitions, tackle unsolved problems. There aren't predefined solutions to look up and apply. Otherwise, we'd just buy something off the shelf and be software **users**. (Much cheaper, if a solution to your problem already exists.)

When faced with a task, your first instinct should be: "How can I solve this puzzle with the tools I have?"

Your first instinct _shouldn't_ be: "Let me Google for a solution to this problem." Developers do a lot of that, of course, but only after we've tried to solve it with what we already have.

"Google-Fu" is a hugely important skill to practice in software development, but in this course you should resist Googling. The answers you find are not suitable for beginners; they will more than likely slow you down. For example, many of those posts will use different syntax than we've seen up until now, and that will be confusing!

Any assigned task _will_ be achievable using the Classes, methods, and keywords introduced in the Ruby Chapters. Your job is to **invent** a combination of them that gets the job done using:

  - The previous Ruby sections (e.g., [`String`](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/9){:target="_blank"}, [`Array`](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/14){:target="_blank"}, [loops](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/16){:target="_blank"}, etc.)

  - The additional methods in [the next section](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/21){:target="_blank"}

  - [The One Ruby Reference](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/33){:target="_blank"} for quick referencing.

### Ruby Gym

Before we go on, let's stop, take a breath, and try to put what we've learned so far to good use. The idea with the following exercises is to use the building blocks from the previous sections to write some small programs. 

These are longer projects than the exercises we've seen so far, and they may require a few different tools to complete; so keep the chapter sections open for reference and scan through them for things that may help when you get stuck. All the tools are there.

Well, almost all the tools! There's a few more collected in the [**next section**](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/21){:target="_blank"} that you may find useful for some of the exercises. Look through them when you get stuck.

There are likely a few ways to solve an exercise. Just get the code to pass all of the `rails grade` tests and you are good to move on. Remember, _we are inventors_; don't rely on Google-Fu.

Please follow the instructions below to enter the Ruby Gym for some weight training üèãÔ∏è!

<div class="proj" markdown="1">

  Open the Gitpod Ruby Gym project that follows this reading and complete the exercises.

  For a Gitpod refresher, see [this section](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/9#start-the-gitpod-project){:target="_blank"} in `String`, where we opened our first workspace.

  The suggested order (feel free to go in whatever order you'd like) is:

  1. `think_fast.rb`
  1. `two_fer.rb`
  1. `dice_roll.rb`
  1. `character_types.rb`
  1. `accumulate.rb`
  1. `secret_encoder.rb`
  1. `secret_decoder.rb`
  1. `leap_year.rb`
  1. `raindrops.rb`
  1. `count_the.rb`
  1. `sum_odd_integers.rb`
  1. `black_jack.rb`
</div>

<div class="proj" markdown="1">

  **Optional stretch goal**

  If you finished the previous exercises, and you want some more, feel free to also work on these _optional_ exercises found in the Ruby Gym:

  1. `anagram.rb`
  1. `isogram.rb`
  1. `hamming.rb`
  1. `darts.rb`
  1. `phrase.rb`
</div>


#### Addendum: Optional Ruby Practice 

If this is your first time programming, then it's a lot of new concepts to absorb! Sometimes hearing the same concepts in different words helps. Here are some other optional resources you can go through at your leisure if you'd like more Ruby practice:

  - Treehouse's [Ruby Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-basics-2){:target="_blank"}

Other than the introduction to Ruby that I‚Äôve written specifically for our purposes, Treehouse's is the one I like best.

If you would like even more practice before we get to our own introduction to Ruby, then there‚Äôs also:

  - CodeCademy's [Learn Ruby track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby){:target="_blank"}, up to and including Part 4 (Arrays and Hashes). (After Part 4, they touch on quite a few concepts that we won‚Äôt use much during AppDev, but are useful in the long run if you continue with Ruby.)

Both Treehouse and CodeCademy have an in-browser programming environment, so it's easy to just start learning right away (no installing of things on your laptop required).

However, be warned that both Treehouse and CodeCademy mention some language features of Ruby that I deliberately cut out in order to keep our learning load as slim as possible. It's not necessarily bad to see them, but we won't be using them in class.
