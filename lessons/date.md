Sure, we could just use a `String` to represent a date, like `"April 19, 1987"`. But Ruby has a built-in class that makes it much easier to work with dates: `Date`.

### Creating a date

**BENP: is this our first library import? Maybe that deserved more of an aside about "gems"?**

The `Date` class isn't loaded into every Ruby program by default, so to use it we first need to say

```ruby
require "date"
```

(Usually we omit the parentheses around the string argument to the `require` method.)

#### Date.new

After `require "date"`, we can create a new instance as usual with:

```ruby
Date.new # => #<Date: -4712-01-01 ((0j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
```

By default, the new date is January 1st, of the year -4712 BCE! Interesting[^julian], but not very helpful.

You can also pass `Date.new` arguments to initialize with a specific year, month, and day:

```ruby
Date.new(2001)            #=> #<Date: 2001-01-01 ...>
Date.new(2001,2,3)        #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
Date.new(2001,2,-1)       #=> #<Date: 2001-02-28 ...>
```

### Date.today

The `Date.today` method returns an object initialized to the current date.

```ruby
Date.today # => #<Date: 2019-04-16 ((2458590j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
```

### year

Call the `year` method on a `Date` object to return just the year of the date as an `Integer`.

```ruby
t = Date.today # => #<Date: 2019-04-16 ((2458590j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
t.year # => 2019
```
### month

Call the `month` method on a `Date` object to return just the month of the date as an `Integer`.

```ruby
t = Date.today # => #<Date: 2019-04-16 ((2458590j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
t.month # => 4
```

### day

Call the `day` method on a `Date` object to return just the day of the date as an `Integer`.

```ruby
t = Date.today # => #<Date: 2019-04-16 ((2458590j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
t.day # => 16
```

### Date.parse

The `Date.parse()` method accepts a `String` argument and tries to interpret it as a date, initializing a `Date` object.

```ruby
Date.parse("2001-02-03") #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
Date.parse("20010203") #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
Date.parse("3rd Feb 2001") #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
```

### Subtraction

You can subtract two dates from one another, which will return the number of days between them. The return value class is a `Rational`, which can be converted to a regular `Integer` with `.to_i`:

```ruby
number_of_days = Date.today - Date.parse("July 4, 1776")
 => (88674/1)
days.to_i
 => 88674
```

### monday?

Returns `true` if the date is a Monday.

### tuesday?

Returns `true` if the date is a Tuesday.

### wednesday?

Returns `true` if the date is a Wednesday.

### thursday?

Returns `true` if the date is a Thursday.

### friday?

Returns `true` if the date is a Friday.

### saturday?

Returns `true` if the date is a Saturday.

### sunday?

Returns `true` if the date is a Sunday.

### wday

Returns the day of week (0-6, Sunday is zero).

```ruby
Date.new(2001,2,3).wday #=> 6
```

### Time

Ruby has a `Time` class as well, that shares most of its methods with the `Date` class.

```ruby
Time.now.wday # => 6
Time.now.saturday? # => true
Time.now.day # => 3
```

#### strftime

The `strftime` method is used on a `Date` or `Time` object. It requires a `String` argument that will be used to format the Date or Time in a particular way.


_Assuming today is Monday, September 7th 2020_

```ruby
Time.now.strftime("%A") # => "Monday"
Time.now.strftime("%B") # => "September"
Time.now.strftime("%b") # => "Sep"
Time.now.strftime("%a %e, %R %p") # => "Mon, 7 14:35 PM"
```

You should **not** try to memorize what these patterns mean. Tools like [strftime.net](http://www.strftime.net){:target="_blank"} and [For a Good Strftime](https://www.foragoodstrftime.com/){:target="_blank"} exist to help compose the formatting string argument.

## Ruby Practice: Date

- Notes:

  - Copied from project README: [https://github.com/appdev-projects/date-chapter](https://github.com/appdev-projects/date-chapter){target="_blank"}

Run your Ruby file by typing `ruby ` and then the name of the file you want to run in the Terminal.

If we want to run `date_math.rb`, we can write the command:

```bash
ruby date_math.rb
```

To re-run this command, you can use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to look at the history of commands you've run in a Terminal.

### date_formatted.rb

Should format and identify different parts of todays date.

```bash
"The year is: 2020, the calendar day is: 1, and the month is: 7."
```


### date_math.rb
Should output the number of days since Ruby was made.

Ruby released to the public on `December 21, 1995`.

```bash
"Ruby is 108937 days old!"
```

### date_monday.rb

Should output:
```bash
"Is today Monday? true"
```
if today is Monday, or
```bash
"Is today Monday? false"
```
if today is _not_ Monday.
