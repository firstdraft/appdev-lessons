# Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) -- Route, Controller, Action, View (RCAV)

We can now use HTML and CSS for designing web pages, and Ruby for writing programs. However, if we (the developers) are the only ones that can _run_ these programs (through the `ruby` interpreter), then they aren't much use. It's time to start adding an _interface_ on top of our Ruby programs so that external users can interact with them.

We already have all the tools to build our first <mark>dynamic web application</mark>. But, before we begin building, we need to understand the URL request lifecycle of _Route, Controller, Action, View (RCAV)_.

In this lesson, we will explore routing. In practice, the project we work through will make our Rock, Paper, Scissors webpage dynamic; meaning it will actually work.
