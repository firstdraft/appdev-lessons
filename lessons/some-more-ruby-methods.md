## Addendum: Some more Ruby methods

Here are some more Ruby methods that we didn't cover in the chapters, but which will likely come in handy in some of the Ruby Gym exercises. Of course, many of these are also collected in [the long Ruby reference][The One Ruby Reference].

### String

#### reverse {-}

The reverse method returns a new `String` with the characters from the `String` in reverse order.

```ruby
p "I can speak in backwords words".reverse
```

#### length {-}

The length method  returns the number of characters (as an `Integer`) that a `String` has.

```ruby
p "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".length
```
