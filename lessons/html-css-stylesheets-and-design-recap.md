  - Copied from [`design-resources.md`](https://github.com/firstdraft/appdev-chapters/blob/benp-edits/design-resources.md){target="_blank"}

As you go about designing and coding your application's screens, here are a few things that you may find useful.

### Readings

I've placed them in rough order of my opinion of their value/length ratio.

 - [Butterick's Typography In Ten Minutes](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html){target="_blank"}
 - [7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1.html){target="_blank"} - and [part 2](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2.html#rule-4-learn-the-methods-of-overlaying-text-on-images){target="_blank"}
 - [Web Design in 4 minutes](http://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/){target="_blank"}
 
### Resources

#### Bootstrap

 - [Official Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/components/){target="_blank"}
 - [Everything in one place](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/cheatsheet/){target="_blank"}
 - [Bootstrap 5 cheatsheet](https://bootstrap-cheatsheet.themeselection.com/){target="_blank"} â€” Since the official docs are really spread out, this cheatsheet can be easier to look through quickly.
 - [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com){target="_blank"} - Cheating! Great for quick styles while prototyping. The previews are also great for looking through quickly for useful components, almost like the Cheat Sheet above.
 - [Shoelace.io](http://shoelace.io){target="_blank"} - A tool to help you create your Bootstrap grid layout.
 - [Premium Bootstrap themes](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/){target="_blank"}
 - [Bootstrap.build](https://bootstrap.build/app){target="_blank"} Generate your own Bootswatch, essentially. If you don't have your own brand identity created yet, you can practice by making a UChicago branded theme; see pages 38-41 of the [Identity Guidelines](https://news.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/_uchicago.identity.guidelines.pdf){target="_blank"}.

#### Other design systems

Bootstrap isn't the only design framework in town. Here are a few more, just to give you an idea:

 - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/components/cards){target="_blank"} â€” Imagine if Bootstrap only had utility classes, like the ones for [spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/utilities/spacing/) and [shadows](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/utilities/shadows/), but had a lot more than it does; and no components per se.

    That's Tailwind â€” you're expected to assemble your own cards, alerts, etc, out of the utility classes. Many people like it because it's "lighter" than Bootstrap â€” it gives you the tools to build up your own, custom framework; but you're still not starting from scratch.
 - [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/){target="_blank"} and [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/){target="_blank"} â€” Government design systems, with accessibility and consistency as paramount concerns.
 - [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/card/){target="_blank"} and [Foundation](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/card.html){target="_blank"} â€” More direct analogs to Bootstrap.


#### Fonts

 - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free){target="_blank"} - Free, CSS-customizable, perfectly scalable icons for almost everything.
 - [Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts){target="_blank"} - You'll want this after reading [Butterick's](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html){target="_blank"}.
 - Google Web Font pairing inspiration:
    - [Typographic Project](http://femmebot.github.io/google-type/){target="_blank"}
    - [Beautiful Web Type](http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/?1){target="_blank"} 
    - [FontPair](https://fontpair.co/){target="_blank"}
    - [Ultimate Google Web Font Pairings](https://www.reliablepsd.com/ultimate-google-font-pairings/){target="_blank"}

#### Games to get good at CSS

 - [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/){target="_blank"} â€” Become a pro at CSS selectors. Useful if you plan to do a lot of web scraping.
 - [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/){target="_blank"} â€” Get a better understanding of Flexbox, the reason that positioning things on the web is no longer a nightmare.

#### Stock images

 - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/){target="_blank"}
 - [Stock Up](http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/stock-up){target="_blank"} - A search engine for free stock photos.
 - [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com){target="_blank"} - A library of free, tileable, subtle background images.
  
#### HTML & CSS references

 - [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input){target="_blank"}
 - [The CSS Cascade](https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade){target="_blank"} â€” Learn how CSS specificity rules actually determine which one of competing rules gets applied to an element.
 - [HTML5 Element List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list){target="_blank"} - An excellent, categorized list of HTML elements.
 - [CSS Properties Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference){target="_blank"}

#### Generators

 - [CSS3 Generator](http://css3gen.com/box-shadow/){target="_blank"} - Generate CSS box shadows, text shadows, and gradients. 
 - [Ultimate CSS Gradient Generator](https://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/){target="_blank"}

#### Colors

 - [Defining colors in CSS](http://web.simmons.edu/~grovesd/comm244/notes/week3/css-colors){target="_blank"}
 - [Duo](https://duo.alexpate.uk/){target="_blank"} â€” Curated color pairings
 - [Adobe Color](http://color.adobe.com){target="_blank"} - Generate complementary colors.

### Quick links to assets

[BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/){target="_blank"} helpfully host `bootstrap.css` (and Bootswatches) on their own server.

Ultimately, a quick and easy way to get all of Bootstrap and Font Awesome is to include the following in the `<head>` of your document:

```html
<!-- Expand the number of characters we can use in the document beyond basic ASCII ðŸŽ‰ -->
<meta charset="utf-8">

<!-- Make it responsive -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

<!-- Connect Bootstrap CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">

<!-- Connect Bootstrap JavaScript and its dependencies -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-QJHtvGhmr9XOIpI6YVutG+2QOK9T+ZnN4kzFN1RtK3zEFEIsxhlmWl5/YESvpZ13" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<!-- Connect Font Awesome -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.1.1/js/all.min.js"></script>
```

You can use a [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com){target="_blank"} or [your own customized `bootstrap.css` instead](https://bootstrap.build){target="_blank"} as the `href`, if you like.

Have fun!
