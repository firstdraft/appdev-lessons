# Gitpod Technical Setup

  - Most of this is in the RPS HTML video, but it could have dedicated content
  - Some of this is also in "Assignment Week 3 (pre-class) Part 3: String" video
  
  - Chapters:
    - `day-2-notes.md`
    - `rails-grade.md`
    - `fixing-your-organization-permissions.md`
    - `gitpod-snapshot.md`
    - `hard-reload.md`

## Video Segment: Setting Up Accounts (da="Tutorial")

  - Setting up github and gitpod
  - Fixing permissions (`fixing-your-organization-permissions.md`)

### Text Companion: Setting Up Accounts (da="HowTo")

## Video Segment: Starting a New Gitpod Project (da="Tutorial")

  - can use RPS HTML as example
  - forking, workspace layout, bin/server, tab management
  - could be chance to talk about file structures and terminal

## Video Segment: Rails Grade and Git Committing (da="Tutorial")

  - kind of awkward placement, this video and text could go early in RPS HTML video
  - manually checking work, rails grade, /git commiting
  - `rails-grade.md`
  - `gitpod-snapshot.md`
