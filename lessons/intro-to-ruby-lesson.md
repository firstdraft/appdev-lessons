# Intro to Ruby

We now have an idea of webpage design with HTML and CSS. That's frontend development in a nutshell. Now it's time to learn how we develop the backend. To do so, we need to learn how to program with the Ruby language. 

Prepare for a crash course in the following sections. Expect short readings interspersed with interactive code exercises. Some of these examples are solved in the accompanying video tutorials, and others are left for you to work through. You will need to complete the exercises as you go.

**_Do_, or do not. There is no  _read_.** Look out for the exercise prompts:

<div class="experiment" markdown="1">
  for sandbox experimentation
</div>

and

<div class="proj" markdown="1">
  for graded projects.
</div>

When you see those, if you aren't typing out every expression, then you're doing it wrong. If you're just _reading_, you won't be successful at learning programming; you have to _do_ in order to build up some muscle memory. _Practice is crucial._
