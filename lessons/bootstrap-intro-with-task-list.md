# Bootstrap Intro with Task List 

(da="Exercise")

  - This video is *not yet transcribed* because it was a lot of visual show-and-tell.

  - Here are some time-stamp notes for things that could be transcribed:

    - **00:19:00 to 00:30:49**: useful `validates`, `has_many`, `reset_session`, new stuff and review

    - **00:31:40 to 00:42:45**: `sample_data` task (already chapter `sample-data.md`, but chapter uses Photogram and here done with Task List)

    - **00:51:06 to 00:53:28**: `force_user_sign_in` and `skip_before_action` is covered for the first time.
