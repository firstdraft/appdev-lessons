At a minimum, we needed to install: An application to write your code with. Something like Microsoft Word is not be ideal for writing code, since code needs to be plain text (just a series of characters in a file, nothing else) for the computer to understand it. Word is designed to write rich text (for humans) with fonts, colors, sizes, margins, layouts, etc. Computers come bundled with some plain text editors (Notepad, TextEdit, etc) but they are very basic. We would instead prefer to use powerful tools specifically designed for writing code with like Microsoft’s VSCode or JetBrains’ RubyMine. Ruby itself. Writing code is not useful on its own if we don’t have something to run it with; just like we need a browser installed to interpret .html files we need Excel installed to interpret .xls files, and we need Photoshop installed to interpret .ps files, we need Ruby installed in order to interpret the .rb files that we write. Not only that, we need the correct version installed. If your computer happened to come with an older version, upgrading to a newer version could be complicated — especially if some other application you use depends on the older version. There are so many different combinations of hardware, operating systems, previously installed software, permission levels (for example if you are using a work-owned computer), that just getting these things installed would often stop you before you started writing your first program. We can’t allow that! Instead, we’re going to use a write our code using a cloud computer. “Cloud” just means that it’s a computer that’s sitting in someone’s warehouse1 somewhere, and we rent it from them. It already has all of the software that we need installed on it, and we access it through our browsers. No muss, no fuss! Gitpod.io is a great new service that provides instantaneous, full-fledged cloud development environments from any codebase that is on GitHub.com — which is great, because we (and 98% of other teams) use GitHub to store all of our projects, homeworks, etc. The text editor they provide is based on Microsoft’s VSCode — my editor of choice. It will have the exact right version of Ruby, Rails, and everything else we need. And they have a very generous free tier. Great! Sign up for a Gitpod.io account. It will ask you to sign in using your GitHub account. We will create a workspace for each project that we work on. Each workspace is based on a GitHub repository (i.e., a folder with some code in it). For example, here is a repository: https://github.com/appdev-projects/helloruby To create a Gitpod workspace based on a repo, in the address bar of your browser enter https://gitpod.io/# and then the URL of the repo. For example, https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/appdev-projects/helloruby To make that process easier, Gitpod has a browser extension that you can install if you want to. Typically, we will assign you a project in Canvas. The assignment will include a button that says “Load assignment in a new window”. When you click on that button, it will create a fork (i.e. a copy) of the repository (i.e. the folder of code) on your own GitHub account. You will then create a Gitpod workspace2 based on your fork, so that you can save the work that you do back to your own GitHub account. A button to create your Gitpod workspace will appear within the assignment, so usually all you need to do is click on it after clicking “Load assignment in a new window”. And then you can get right to work, with the exact right version of all of the project’s dependencies ready to go! 3.2.2 Forcing Chrome to “Hard” Refresh Notes: Copied from hard-reload.md Sometimes, when we update a CSS stylesheet, our page appears not to change. This is especially frequent when we’re working on static HTML files in the public/ folder. The cause is usually Chrome’s aggressive “caching”, i.e. re-using static assets that it has already downloaded (for performance reasons). If we refresh an HTML page that we’ve updated, Chrome won’t necessarily also refresh all &lt;link&gt;ed CSS files — unless we ask it to by “hard” refreshing. To do so: Open the Dev Tools… from the View &gt; Developer menu or right-click on any element and Inspect or press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+J (on Windows) or Option+Command+J (on Mac) Right-click on the refresh button. Select “Empty cache and hard reload”. Open Dev Tools: With Dev Tools open, “hard” refresh: Your HTML document should now have the latest CSS and any other linked assets (like images or javascripts). 3.2.3 Gitpod keyboard shortcuts and other productivity tips Notes: Copied from tips-and-tricks.md 3.2.3.1 Important Terminal keystrokes to know 3.2.3.1.1 Jump to beginning of line You can’t use your mouse at the command line, so it’s important to know how to move around quickly so you’re not restricted to just using your arrows. Jump back to the beginning of the line with Ctrl + A: 3.2.3.1.2 Jump to end of line Mac OS, Windows: Ctrl + E 3.2.3.1.3 Up and down arrows to scroll through your history Use your up and down arrows to scroll through your command history so that you don’t have to re-type your commands over and over. 3.2.3.1.4 Clear Terminal Mac OS: Command + K Windows: Disabled by default3 From the menu open Preferences and select Keyboard shortcuts. Then search for “terminal clear” in the search bar and click the plus icon to the left of it. Finally, type ctrl + k and Enter to confirm. 3.2.3.1.5 Interrupt command If something goes wrong with a terminal program (i.e. you made a typo, a program gets stuck in an infinite loop, etc), you can generally interrupt it with Ctrl + C: 3.2.3.1.6 Q to exit When the output of a terminal command is too tall for a terminal tab to display at once, it paginates. Press Space to step through it one page at a time, or Q to quit and get back to the terminal prompt so that you can execute your next command. Mac OS, Windows: Q 3.2.3.2 Editor keyboard shortcuts 3.2.3.2.1 Command Palette The most important thing to memorize is how to open the Command Palette, which will allow you to fuzzy search within for all other commands. If the command has a keyboard shortcut mapped to it, the shortcut will be displayed to the right. This is the best way to learn the keyboard shortcuts for the commands that you use most frequently. Mac OS: Command + Shift + P Windows: Ctrl + Shift + P 3.2.3.2.2 Quick open file To quickly jump to a file: Mac OS: Command + P Windows: Ctrl + P And then fuzzily search for its name. For example, you could type “phco” to get to photos_controller.rb and the list would quickly narrow to bring that file to the top of the list. 3.2.3.2.3 Toggle Code Comment To quickly comment a line of code, put your cursor on that line and then: Mac OS: Command + / Windows: Ctrl + / You can also highlight multiple lines of code and comment/uncomment all of them at once. 3.2.3.2.4 Find (and replace) Mac OS: Command + F Windows: Ctrl + F 3.2.3.2.5 Find Next Selection Mac OS: Command + D Windows: Ctrl + D If you go too far by mistake, you can step backwards with Command + U or Ctrl + U. 3.2.3.2.6 Move line Mac OS: Option + ⬇ Windows: Alt + ⬇ 3.2.3.2.7 Duplicate line Mac OS: Shift + Option + ⬇ Windows: Shift + Alt + ⬇ 3.2.3.2.8 Add/Remove Tab spaces for multiple lines Mac OS: (Shift) + Tab Windows: (Shift) + Tab 3.2.3.2.9 Add More Cursors Mac OS: Option + Click Windows: Alt + Click 3.2.3.2.10 Embedded Ruby (ERB) Tag Toggle Mac OS, Windows: Ctrl + Shift + ` 3.2.3.2.11 Toggle Terminal Panel Mac OS: Command + J Windows: Ctrl + J 3.2.3.2.12 Open New Terminal Mac OS: Ctrl + ~ (i.e. Ctrl + Shift + `) Windows: Ctrl + ~ (i.e. Ctrl + Shift + `) A warehouse full of computers that people rent and connect to via the internet is called a “data center”. Some data centers have their own power plants, and some are even earthquake-proofed.↩︎ Gitpod will delete an inactive workspace after 14 days. If you want to save the changes you’ve made for longer, you can “pin” a workspace in Gitpod which will prevent it from being deleted. Even better, you can push your changes to Github.↩︎ A recent Gitpod update removed this keyboard shortcut for Windows, so you’ll need to configure it yourself.↩︎ "],["using-git-to-freely-experiment-and-save-work.html", "3.3 Using Git to freely experiment and save work", " 3.3 Using Git to freely experiment and save work Notes: Copied from using-git-to-experiement-and-save-work.md 3.3.1 What Git is Git is an extremely powerful version-control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, which is one of the largest open-source software projects in existence. It makes it possible for large numbers of contributors to work on various features, all within a single codebase (which could be comprised of hundreds or thousands of files). Bitbucket, GitLab, and especially GitHub (all private companies) rode the rise of Git (the protocol) to become the center of the software development universe. All of these companies basically offer cloud-based storage for codebases using Git for version-control (we refer to these codebases as repositories), as well as a web-based interface for collaborating on them — following, commenting, etc. 3.3.2 Why we care In this course, we’re going to use one simple but effective Git-based workflow to save versions of our work. This will allow us to freely experiment with different approaches, while never having to throw away code. In all of our Rails apps, after you start the server, you can navigate to the address /git in your live application. If you’re using Gitpod, the URL will look like: https://[YOUR GITPOD WORKSPACE URL].gitpod.io/git That will open a page that looks like this: As soon as you make any changes to any of the code in the project, and refresh this page, the lines that you changed will appear: On the left, you see the code as it was previously; on the right, you see the new code. Lines added are highlighted in green, lines removed are highlighted in red. Below, there are two things you can do: commit your changes on the left, and switch to a new branch on the right. When you hear the word “commit”, think “snapshot”. When you hear the word “branch”, think “version”. A Git commit is a snapshot of all of the folders and files in your project at a particular time. Since our files of code are all interdependent, it doesn’t make sense to save versions of individual files — we need to know the entire state of the project for a version to be useful. Each branch (“version”) is a series of commits (“snapshots”). The most important thing for you to remember is simple: commit early and commit often. As long as you are taking snapshots of your work at various points, it will always be easy to get back to a previous state in case you want to start over and explore a different approach. To commit, enter a title for the snapshot (required), and, optionally, a longer description: After you commit, you will no longer have any pending changes: If you edit your code again, then you can make further commits. Fundamentally, that’s all you need to worry about: just make lots of commits as you work. The best time to commit is right after you just got something to work, before you start on your next experiment. Remember: ABC: Always Be Committing. 3.3.3 Jumping back in time In the History dialog at the bottom, you can see a list of all of the commits you’ve made. If you want to jump back in time to one of them, copy the 7 letter code (known as the “hash” of the commit; it is a unique identifier) in front of it into the “Branch off of” field above. Pick a name for a new version, and click “Create a new branch off of…”. It will snap all of the files in the project back to that point in time, and you can now make further commits along a new path — while still retaining all of your old commits on the old path. You can easily jump to any commit from any branch at any time — so feel free to experiment! Make a commit to save your current work, then jump back to a previous commit to try a different approach. 3.3.4 Switch to a Different Branch Have you gone back in time and decided your first attempt was better? Turn your attention to the “Existing Branches” panel on the right. This will list any branches your project has— master is the default starting branch. To switch to a different branch, click the blue double arrow button next to the name of the branch you want to switch to. If you’re ever unsure of what branch you’re on, the top of the page should list “On branch ___”. 3.3.5 Push to GitHub Gitpod workspaces are not permanent. Even if we make git commits, if the workspace is deleted so is all of our work! This is where GitHub comes in. We can push all of the commits we’ve made to our repository on GitHub where it will live forever. If our Gitpod workspace gets destroyed we can just re-create another one from the latest commit on GitHub! Before you can push to GitHub, you need to give Gitpod access. Head over to the Integrations under your account settings in Gitpod and make sure you check “public repos” and click “Update”. This should open a GitHub authorization dialogue. Make sure to click “Grant” next to the GitHub organization you created for class Now you should be all set to push your commits to GitHub!

Also, don’t forget to check your email and verify the address you entered. For now, think of GitHub like Dropbox-for-programmers; it’s where we’re going to store all of our code. 3.4.1.2 Create GitHub organization To keep things organized, we’re going to create a separate GitHub organization account for you to store your AppDev projects under (to keep them separate from the personal projects that you’ll hopefully be building soon!). Click the + on the right side of the navbar and select “New organization”: Choose any name for the organization; most students choose [YOUR USERNAME]-appdev.

Scroll down to the assignment you want to start and click the link that says ‘Load [your assignment name] in a new window’ (the name of the project will vary). Before you click “Authorize”, make sure to click the “Grant” button next to the organization that you created earlier. Only then, click authorize to allow the firstdraft Grades application to access your account. Select the name of your GitHub organization and submit the form. The next screen will ask you to accept an invitation to a GitHub team. You can click the link on that screen to accept, or you’ll have an invitation in your email inbox as well. Once you’ve joined, you should see feedback that you’re now a member of appdev-projects: 3.4.1.4 Daily workflow The stuff above about setting up your organization and permissions was just a one-time thing. From now on, you’ll just head to Canvas and click “Load assignment in a new tab”. You should see something like the following (the name of the project will vary): We will automatically make a copy (a “fork”, in GitHub parlance) of the repository under your new GitHub organization. Then, you can choose to either “Create new workspace in Gitpod” or head to your “Gitpod Dashboard” to view existing workspaces. Either way, once you’re in the workspace, we can get the project loaded up and try out the feedback feature. After the bin/setup script is done running, start working on the project to do whatever the instructions tell you. When you’re ready for feedback, try a new command at a new Terminal prompt: rails grade You’ll be asked for your access token; copy-paste it carefully from the grades.firstdraft.com page that you loaded from Canvas. You should see output that looks like: Copy-paste the Results URL into a new tab, or click on it (but make sure it isn’t truncated). (Some projects aren’t graded; in that case there may only be one dummy test listed.) You can click on one of the tests to get more feedback on what might have gone wrong: In this case, the test expected to find an element with a class of word_count that contains the number 10, but instead it only found the content “Replace this string with your answer”. You can click the “Examine Test” button to read the actual Ruby of the automated test; it’s surprisingly readable. Ruby’s testing libraries use method names that are supposed to make tests readable even for non-technical managers and clients. You can see specifically what flow is being tested and what inputs are being used and what the expected output is, and try to reproduce the issue in your own app manually using the same inputs. You can run rails grade in your Terminal as many times as you want, and you will get a new updated build report each time. It will only report your highest score back to Canvas. Remember that your first job is always to make your app work as described and test it manually yourself. You should not rely exclusively on the automated tests; they are a terrible way to debug. 3.4.2 Fixing your organization permissions Notes: Copied from fixing-your-organization-permissions.md Once upon a time, we all created our own GitHub organizations to keep our classwork separate from our personal projects. Since then, whenever we gave permission to a third-party (like Gitpod or grades.firstdraft.com) to access our GitHub accounts, we were supposed to remember to grant access to our organization too. If you forgot to click “Grant” next to the organization that you created before you clicked “Authorize”, you’re going to run into problems. Let’s fix it. Go to GitHub and sign in. In this example, I am signed in as the user demolearner1. Click on the user icon in the top-right and find “Settings”: Next, click on “Organizations” in the left sidebar: Find the organization that you created. You likely picked a name like [YOUR USERNAME]-appdev: Next, go to the Settings of the organization: In the left sidebar, find “Third-party access”: If it says that you approved both, then you are good to go and you can go to the next section. If neither Cloud9 nor Grades appears in this list, click the “Remove restrictions” button instead and you can go to the next section. If it says that access is Denied next to Cloud9 or Grades, then proceed. Click on whichever one you denied and Grant Access: You should see a message confirming that access has been granted: Repeat for the other third-party app if necessary. 3.4.2.1 Make sure that you’ve accepted your team invitation Visit this page and make sure that you don’t have a banner across the top asking you to accept our team invitation. (This invitation was sent a while ago via email; if you’ve already accepted it, the banner won’t appear.) 3.4.2.2 Launch an assignment from within Canvas Head back to Canvas and click on whichever assignment you want to work on again (don’t just refresh it if you already had it up). You might be asked to enter your organization name — be sure to enter your organization name, the one you created; not appdev-projects. 3.4.2.3 Resetting OAuth permissions to square one If for some reason you need to make a single-sign-on provider (like GitHub, Twitter, or Facebook) “forget” that you ever authorized a third-party app, maybe because you don’t use it anymore or maybe because you want to change the permissions that you gave it, you need to delete or revoke the “access token” that you previously issued to it. In the case of GitHub, go to your personal settings: Find “Applications” in the left sidebar: Click the “Authorized OAuth Apps” tab and then click “Revoke” next to whichever one you want to “forget”: Then, return to the third-party app and “Sign in with…” again to start over from scratch. In our case, click on an assignment from within Canvas again to re-start the authorization process — and this time don’t forget to grant access to the organization that you created. 3.4.3 Sharing a Gitpod Snapshot Notes: Copied from gitpod-snapshot.md It’s often helpful to share a snapshot of the state of your entire Gitpod workspace with someone else. 3.4.3.1 Take the snapshot From the hamburger menu in the top-left corner of your IDE, select Gitpod: Share Workspace Snapshot: 3.4.3.2 Copy the snapshot URL It will take a moment to create the snapshot. Then a dialog will pop up in the bottom-right corner that will give you the URL to copy and share: 3.4.3.2.1 The correct URL looks like this The URL that you share should look something like this: https://gitpod.io#snapshot/5a47e40d-e279-44e5-96bc-ae33cd48f151 Note the #snapshot fragment of the URL. That means you have the right one. 3.4.3.2.2 Not this The URL should not look something like this: https://ac1bde40-34e8-421d-a102-6425971fb9db.ws-eu38.gitpod.io/ That is the URL of your own IDE, which no one else can access. 3.4.3.2.3 Or this The URL should not look something like this: https://3000-ac1bde40-34e8-421d-a102-6425971fb9db.ws-eu38.gitpod.io Note the 3000- at the start. That is the URL of the live preview of your app. 3.4.3.3 Snapshots are completely independent When someone clicks on the snapshot URL, they will get their own private copy of your workspace in the state that it was in when you took the snapshot. Any changes they make to their copy will not affect your workspace. Similarly, any changes you make to your workspace won’t affect their snapshot. So you can keep trying to resolve the problem on your own, or work on the next task, without interfering with their snapshot.

You can use the web interface at /git, or you can run the following commands at a terminal prompt: git add -A git commit -m &quot;Describe your changes&quot; At a terminal prompt, git push heroku HEAD:main -f That’s it! Your app will be available, once deployed, at https://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com (or whatever name you chose or were assigned). Repeat the two steps above as many times as you like to deploy new changes. 5.0.5 Set environment variables If you need to set any environment variables on Heroku to mirror the ones you have locally (to e.g. store credentials securely), you can do it in the application’s settings in your Heroku dashboard{:target=\"_blank“}. (Heroku refers to environment variables as”Config Vars\".) 5.0.6 Optional: set a custom domain To put your app behind a custom domain name, you must first verify your identity by adding a credit card to your Heroku account. This will also lift your app limit from 5 to 100. Then, at a terminal prompt: heroku domains:add www.your-domain.com You will see some instructions: heroku domains:add www.your-domain.com Adding test.appdevproject.com to ⬢ my-awesome-app... done Configure your app&#39;s DNS provider to point to the DNS Target young-peony-foamxxrzcu9xzxd286waw6ay.herokudns.com.

Create a CNAME record that points www to the target that Heroku gave you (in the example above, young-peony-foamxxrzcu9xzxd286waw6ay.herokudns.com). That’s it! It usually takes a few minutes to take effect. 5.0.7 Seeing error messages When your users run into errors, we don’t want them to see the gory details of what went wrong. So, rather then show them the detailed error messages, we just show them a generic “Something went wrong” page when running the application in production mode. But then, how will you debug errors that your users will, inevitably, discover in your code? Eventually, you should add a service like Rollbar, which will automatically log every error and send you a detailed report. But for now, you should look at the error message in your server log. How can you look at your Heroku server log? With this command: heroku logs --tail That will show us what’s going over there in California: BENP: missing image, not in assets. See source You’ll notice that the production server log is not as helpful as the development log! What I do is clear the Terminal with Cmd+K, and then refresh the request that was causing the error. I then scroll to the top of the mess, and start to look through carefully for the error message. 5.0.8 Running rake tasks automatically You can run rake tasks on a schedule very easily on Heroku. First, heroku addons:create scheduler:standard Then, heroku addons:open scheduler It will give you a URL to open, at which you’ll find a dashboard. You can then specify a task (e.g. rails send_sms or whatever you named your task) and a frequency that you want the task to be run. Your options are every day, every hour, and every 10 minutes. That’s it! If you have Multi-Factor Authentication{:target=\"_blank“} enabled, then instead of your password you’ll need to paste an API Key.

Here are a few more, just to give you an idea: Tailwind CSS — Imagine if Bootstrap only had utility classes, like the ones for spacing and shadows, but had a lot more than it does; and no components per se. That’s Tailwind — you’re expected to assemble your own cards, alerts, etc, out of the utility classes. Many people like it because it’s “lighter” than Bootstrap — it gives you the tools to build up your own, custom framework; but you’re still not starting from scratch.

The only place you can include a URL is in your bio, and you can only include one. This soon led to a trend of people promoting something with a post, but including “Link in bio!” in the caption. They would then update the solitary link in their bio to the latest thing they wanted to promote. Soon, a bunch of services cropped up that allow people to manage multiple links in a single, mobile-friendly page; and include a link to that page in their bio. The most popular of these is Linktree, but there are many others. Linktree has many users, from media companies to celebrities to, most likely, some of your friends — and maybe even you? Here are some examples: HBO’s Instagram bio: And HBO’s list of links: Katy Perry’s Instagram bio: And Katy Perry’s list of links: In this project, we’re going to build our own mobile-friendly list of links that we can include in our social media profiles or anywhere else that we like. Here’s mine: There are several benefits to writing our own rather than using a service like Linktree: We can use our own custom domain name for it; rather than linktree.com/raghubetina, notice that my URL is simply rag.hu. We don’t have to pay. Linktree has a free tier with limited design options, but if you want access to the fun themes, analytics, or to remove the Linktree branding, you have to subscribe to their $5/mo or $9/mo plan. We have all the power of CSS at our fingerprints to customize the design. Linktree, like all “no code” tools, limits you to a set of pre-defined constraints that you have to work within. Not so if you’re writing the code yourself. For example, if you click through to mine, you’ll notice a lot of touches that aren’t available options even on the paid Linktree plans: an animated background, a “frosted glass” effect on the links, etc. It’s just plain fun! Let’s get started. "],["getting-started.html", "9.1 Getting started", " 9.1 Getting started We’re going to start our projects a little differently this time. Rather than clicking the “Load [assignment] in a new window” button in Canvas, which usually will automatically create your copy of the repository on your organization, you will manually create your own blank Rails app (the same steps you can follow any time you want to build your own, non-assigned projects): Visit our appdev-projects/base-rails repository and click the “Use this template” button. Then select “Create new repository” from the dropdown. On the next screen, leave the “Owner” dropdown alone. For “Repository name”, enter “your-username.github.io”. Substitute your own, real username for your-username. So, for example, my repo name is “raghubetina.github.io”. Make sure to include the “.github.io” part in the repo name. E.g.: Click “Create new repository from template”. Create a new Gitpod workspace based on your brand new repository: In a new tab’s address bar, type “gitpod.io/#”. Then copy-paste the URL of your new repository after that. The URL should look something like gitpod.io/#https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io Press return to visit that URL and Gitpod will automatically start creating a new workspace for you. Once you’re in to your new workspace, bin/server at a terminal tab as usual to start up your web server. Open your app preview in a new tab. Create a file called index.html in the public/ folder.

Unsplash is a great resource for high quality stock images if you don’t want to use an image of yourself. The URLs of your social media profiles. I used my GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter pages. A list of links you want to share. I used a handful of essays and short stories that I find myself sharing with people often. Here are some examples that you can peruse for inspiration. A thumbnail image for each link. I used a few strategies to find an image for each link: Search Google images and look for one hosted on wikimedia.org. Searched Unsplash for a relevant image. Generate an image with AI. I downloaded the image and then uploaded it to my Gitpod workspace by drag-and-dropping it into the public/ folder. If you want to, you can use fake placeholder images and links for everything, but I encourage you to gather real content. It’ll be more fun, you’ll end up with a page that you can actually use on your social media profiles, and you’ll have a good piece for your portfolio.

Two things to notice: I’m using the target=\"_blank\" attribute on any links that I want to open in a new tab. For images that I am serving from my own public/ folder: I created a subfolder called thumbnails to help keep things organized, and moved the images there. When referencing the URL of the image in a src=\"\" attribute, I start with a leading slash — e.g.: &lt;img src=&quot;/thumbnails/typography.jpg&quot;&gt; I do not include /public in the URL. At this stage, your page technically serves its purpose — a collection of links people can click on — but it probably looks terrible, like this. "],["html-validator.html", "9.4 HTML Validator", " 9.4 HTML Validator If at any point your HTML breaks, or you suspect you e.g. forgot a closing tag but can’t find it, the W3C HTML Validator might come in handy. Paste in your entire HTML document and click “Check”, and it will give you a list of feedback. Some of them are yellow warnings and can be safely ignored for now, but any critical mistakes (like missing closing tags or quotation marks) will show up as red errors. For example, if you run your HTML through the validator right now (try it), it will display a bunch of errors because we don’t have alt=\"\" attributes on our &lt;img&gt;s. These are important to include for accessibility reasons, and just in case the image breaks for some reason (i.e. the URL changes). We should add descriptive alternative text for each image.

"],["sizing-images.html", "9.6 Sizing images", " 9.6 Sizing images Now, let’s start to make the page look better. Let’s add a &lt;style&gt; element inside the &lt;head&gt; of the document so that we can begin applying CSS. We won’t use an external stylesheet for now, since we’re only planning to apply this CSS to a single page. Maybe we can start by giving the body some breathing room with top and bottom padding: &lt;style&gt; body { padding-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 40px; } &lt;/style&gt; Let’s start by sizing the profile picture. We need to give it a class so that we can apply CSS rules to it — let’s call it banner-image: &lt;div class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;profile-pic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Raghu Betina headshot&quot; class=&quot;banner-image&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Then, let’s make the banner image 128 pixels by 128 pixels: &lt;style&gt; .banner-image { width: 128px; height: 128px; } &lt;/style&gt; Unless your original image was exactly square, this probably will look squished when you check out the results. To solve this problem, we can use the object-fit property: .banner-image { width: 128px; height: 128px; object-fit: cover; } It’s quite common to see circular profile pictures. If you want to, set a large border-radius to achieve that: .banner-image { width: 128px; height: 128px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 128px; } I didn’t use one on my profile picture, but you should feel free to get creative with borders, as well. Similarly, let’s size all of the thumbnail images as 48px by 48px: .thumbnail { width: 48px; height: 48px; border-radius: 48px; object-fit: cover; } Don’t forget to add the class to the relevant &lt;img&gt; elements. Now, your page should look something like this — much better. "],["basic-colors.html", "9.7 Basic colors", " 9.7 Basic colors Let’s add some color to make it easier to see how much space each element is occupying. We’ll, at a minimum, need a color for the background of the entire page and for each link. You can come up with your own palette, or you can use Happy Hues, a nice set of curated color palettes. I used this palette. I used the background color, headline color, button color, and button text color like this: body { background-color: #004643; } .name { color: #fffffe; } .social-icons a { color: #fffffe; text-decoration: none; } .link { background-color: #f9bc60; } .link a { color: #001e1d; text-decoration: none; } As you can see, I also removed the underlines from links with text-decoration: none. Notice that I used the descendant combinator: .link a { /* ... */ } This selector targets only &lt;a&gt; elements that are descendants of elements with class link. This is a handy alternative to adding a new class to all of the elements I’m interested in targeting.5 My page now looks like this. If you want to become a pro at writing CSS selectors, I recommend an interactive tutorial/game called CSS Diner. If you make it through all 32 levels, you’ll be better than most front-end developers at writing advanced CSS selectors. In addition to making it easier to style your own pages, knowing how to write advanced selectors will pay dividends if you’re interested in doing any web scraping.↩︎ "],["layout.html", "9.8 Layout", " 9.8 Layout Now, for the interesting part — laying out the elements where we want them on the page. 9.8.1 Overall page layout Since this is a relatively simple, single-column layout, we could stay in the normal flow mode and achieve most of the positioning that we want with margin and padding. But let’s use display: flex instead. It will make it much easier to do things like vertically center the text within each link’s box. First, I’ll wrap all of our content — the div.banner, the div.name, the div.social-icons, and all of the div.links — within a new parent &lt;div&gt; with a class called items. This will make it easier for me to position and size everything uniformly. Then I will switch the layout mode of the new div.items from the default normal flow to flex: .items { display: flex; } If you try that and refresh your page, you’ll see that all of the elements are now horizontally side-by-side. This is because the default flex-direction is row. Let’s switch the flex-direction to column to lay them out vertically again: .items { display: flex; flex-direction: column; } If you refresh, you’ll see the layout is vertical again. When we’re using display: flex mode, we can use the gap property to provide some breathing room between each child element, rather than having to add margin: .items { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 30px; } On laptop screens, the buttons are running all the way to the edge of the screen, which isn’t very attractive. Let’s set a max-width of around 640px (you choose a value that looks good to you): .items { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 30px; max-width: 640px; } 9.8.2 Layout for each link Within each link, it would be nice if: The thumbnail and text were vertically centered within the box. The text was horizontally centered in the space remaining next to the thumbnail. display: flex to the rescue! 9.8.2.1 Vertically centering with align-items We can vertically center child elements with the align-items property: .link { background-color: #f9bc60; display: flex; align-items: center; } If you refresh, the thumbnails should be lined up nicely with the link text. 9.8.2.2 flex-grow Next, let’s center the text of each link. I’m going to expand the existing rule that we have for .link a. Can we simply add text-align: center and call it a day? .link a { color: #001e1d; text-decoration: none; text-align: center; } If you refresh, you’ll see that didn’t work. Why? To make it easier to see things while I am working on layouts, I often use the following hack: * { border: thin red solid; } This puts a thin red border around every element. Your page should now look something like this: We can see that the &lt;a&gt; elements are only just wide enough to fit their content, so centering within them isn’t doing anything. Instead, we want the &lt;a&gt; element to occupy all of the available space to the right of the thumbnail. To achieve, this we can use the flex-grow property: .link a { color: #001e1d; text-decoration: none; text-align: center; flex-grow: 1; } Now the &lt;a&gt; element grows to fill any available space, while the &lt;img&gt; element stays the same size (it still has the default value for flex-grow, which is 0). And our text should be nicely centered since we already added the text-align. 9.8.2.3 justify-content Now let’s take care of centering the profile picture and name, as well as putting some breathing room between the social links. Flexbox has a wonderful property called justify-content that will help with all of these things: .name { color: #fffffe; display: flex; justify-content: center; } .banner { display: flex; justify-content: center; } .social-icons { display: flex; justify-content: space-around; } You could also use the same technique to center the div.items within the &lt;body&gt;: body { display: flex; justify-content: center; } But then we again need to tell the child elements to grow to take up all available space with flex-grow: .items { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 30px; max-width: 640px; flex-grow: 1; } Our page layout should now look solid! Let’s add a little bit of padding inside our div.links: .link { background-color: #f9bc60; display: flex; align-items: center; padding: 5px; } It should now be safe to remove the * { border: thin red solid; } hack, unless you want to continue playing with layout, padding, etc. Our page now looks something like this. "],["deploy.html", "9.9 Deploy!", " 9.9 Deploy! We’ve made a lot of progress, and our list of links is functional and looking pretty solid! We can and will spend more time fine-tuning, but this seems like a great time to deploy our app to industrial-grade hosting so that we can actually link to it in our bios! Sadly, after over a decade, Heroku’s free tier was eliminated as of November 28th, 2022. There are some silver linings — they have launched a new discount through GitHub Student, and they created a couple of new, less expensive plans (Eco, Basic, Mini). For full-stack, dynamic, interactive, database-backed apps, I plan to still use Heroku. However, Heroku is no longer a good choice for hosting static HTML websites. There are several other free and fast options for that (e.g. Netlify and Vercel). Today, I want to show you GitHub’s offering for hosting static websites: GitHub Pages. We will deploy our Link In Bio via GitHub Pages. This will have several benefits: It’s free. It is tightly integrated with GitHub repositories (obviously), so all we need to do to deploy is what we do anyway — make a commit and push to GitHub . It doesn’t have any of Heroku’s old free tier’s restrictions. It will be up 24/7/365. It automatically includes SSL for custom domains (important if you’re using a top-level domain that requires https, like .dev). GitHub Pages sites are automatically assigned a subdomain under .github.io. This carries some developer cred. Or you can easily use your own domain. Here’s what to do to get your first GitHub Pages site going: Visit /git. Make a commit and then push the changes you’ve made so far to your GitHub repository. That’s it! In a few minutes, your site should be live at https://your-username.github.io! Eventually, consider adding some other pages to your site besides just index.html — a list of projects that you’ve built, for example. If you want to use a custom domain name like yourname.com rather than something like your-username.github.io, then you’ll first have to purchase a domain. I recommend Porkbun, or, for more exotic top-level domains, Gandi.net. Here is a guide to adding your own domain to your Pages site. Let me know if you get stuck. You can create as many GitHub Pages sites as you want — one per repo. Read more about GitHub Pages here.

If you think about it that way, then you already know at least one programming language: In the case of a calculator, the “information” is numbers and the “useful things” are adding, subtracting, multiplying, etc. Like any computer (or person), we get the calculator to do useful work by writing instructions that it can understand. For example, if we press the keys 7 × 6 = (in that order), then the calculator will return 42 on the screen; but if we press the keys x 7 = 6, then it won’t. In the above example, 7 and 6 are known as data, or as I think of it, nouns. x and = are known as methods, or as I think of it, verbs. The order in which we press the keys is known as syntax, or as I think of it, grammar. Altogether, some data and some methods put together using correct syntax form an expression, or as I think of it, a sentence. Given a valid expression, the computer will process it and return a piece of useful data back to us. A basic calculator’s entire vocabulary consists of the following: Data 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . Methods = + - × ÷ % ± AC And there are only a few syntax rules: Primary syntax: A number, then an operator, then another number, then the =. Numbers can contain a single decimal point. Numbers can be modified by the plus/minus sign. Numbers can be modified by the percentage sign. Can press AC to reset. It’s a very small language, but it demonstrates the same parts as any other programming language: data, methods, and syntax. Got it? Good, because that’s basically all that there is to any other programming language, too! It’s just that its vocabulary will be bigger, and it will have a more grammar rules. 10.1.2 Ruby’s vocabulary Let’s start learning your second programming language — Ruby! As we now know, that means we need to familiarize ourselves with Ruby’s data, methods, and the syntax for putting them together. First of all, Ruby can work with many more kinds of data than just numbers. That’s what makes it much more powerful than the calculator language. Ruby has: Numbers Text Dates Times True/false Lists containing multiple pieces of data And a lot more Each kind, or class, of data has its own set of methods that it can perform. For example: Numbers can do the usual things — add, subtract, multiply, etc. Two dates can tell you how far apart they are from one another. Lists can tell how you long they are, or sort themselves. Ruby is known as a “batteries included” language because it comes with so many methods out-of-the-box, saving the programmer the trouble of having to re-invent the wheel. Finally, we can even make up our own nouns and verbs and add them to the language. For example, we can create a data type Venue, give it a method that calculates the average rating from its reviews, and then use that method whenever we want. One of the best things about Ruby is its wonderful open-source community: programmers very often share these new classes that they write with one another, making the language ever easier to use and ever more powerful. 10.1.3 Ruby’s primary syntax So, in terms of data and methods, Ruby comes with a powerful set out-of-the-box and is always getting better. That’s good news! Here’s even more good news: to access all of this power, the primary syntax is straightforward. It looks like this: some_object.some_method Here’s a real example: &quot;hello world!&quot;.upcase Here, you try it. Click here to visit repl.it{:target=\"_blank“}, a service that offers instant programming sandboxes within your browser. Click the”Fork\" button in the top right and sign in with your Github account. “Forking” a Repl will copy the Repl to your own account and allow you to edit it. In the black window that appears at the bottom of the window, type: irb and press return. This will launch interactive Ruby (IRB), a program that lets you evaluate one Ruby expression at a time. At the irb(main) prompt that appears, you can now try out \"hello world!\".upcase: If all went well, you should have seen =&gt; \"HELLO WORLD!\" in the black window at the bottom (known as the “terminal”). Yay6! What just happened? The primary way to write an expression in Ruby is: object.method. We ask the thing, or noun, on the left side of the dot to perform the action, or the verb, on the right side of the dot. The computer then evaluates that expression and returns a new piece of data in its place (just like with the calculator). In this case, we asked \"hello world!\", which is a string (Ruby’s name for a piece of text7), to upcase itself, which it (very) happily does, and we’re left with \"HELLO WORLD!\" at the end of the day. BENP: shorten ^string_name footnote. delete after ; 10.1.4 Every class has different methods Different classes can perform different methods. Here are a few expressions to try out. Type each one into IRB. 7.odd? 7.even? &quot;Mississippi&quot;.length &quot;Raghu Betina&quot;.reverse &quot;Your Name&quot;.swapcase Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} What do you expect will happen if we ask \"Mississippi\" if it is even?? Try it: &quot;Mississippi&quot;.even? 10.1.4.1 Do, or do not. There is no read. If you weren’t typing out every expression in a REPL, then you’re doing this wrong. If you’re just reading, you won’t be successful at learning programming; you have to do in order to build up some muscle memory. Practice is crucial. In fact, not only should you be typing the things I ask you to type, but you should also be trying out random other things that occur to you. (E.g., \"What if I tried \"Mississippi\".length.even?) Experiment! 10.1.4.2 Read. The. Error. Message. (A.k.a., “RTEM”) Aha! If you were typing out every expression and running it, then &quot;Mississippi&quot;.even? should have produced your very first error message!  Error messages can look scary, but one of the most important skills you have to develop when learning to program is to not panic when you see them. Slow down, read the error message, and see if you can make any sense of it at all. Over time, you will find that they are very helpful (and you will miss them if something goes wrong silently). So, what do you think undefined method `even?&#39; for &quot;Mississippi&quot;:String might mean? In this case, it is saying: “Hey, friend — there’s no method called even? for \"Mississippi\", which is a String. Sorry.” Fair enough, that makes sense. 10.1.4.2.1 The bottom line The bottom line is — at all times as you are writing Ruby, you should be thinking: “What class is this object? What methods does this class have available?” Then, the syntax itself is simple — my_object.cool_method. 10.1.5 Arguments are inputs Alright, so the primary syntax in Ruby is straightforward — object.method. However, there’s a wrinkle: some methods require additional inputs. For example, there is a method called gsub which we can call on Strings, which will substitute characters with other characters. Try it: &quot;Java is a joy&quot;.gsub(&quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Ruby&quot;) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} gsub is short for “globally substitute”, because it will replace all occurrences of one substring with another substring. In order to do its job, the gsub method needs to know what substring to get rid of and what to replace it with. So we give it inputs, or arguments, which must come in parentheses immediately following the method. If the method takes multiple arguments, as gsub does, then they are separated by commas. Try replacing \"Java is a joy\" with any string you like, and experiment with different arguments instead of \"Java\" and \"Ruby\". For example, maybe start with \"resume\" and try to transform it into \"résumé\" using gsub. What is the purpose of gsub’s first argument, and what is the purpose of the second argument? In reality, gsub is more often used to do things like removing illegal characters from usernames before saving, e.g.: &quot;Raghu@Bet@ina&quot;.gsub(&quot;@&quot;, &quot;&quot;) (\"\" is an empty string, so all @s will be replaced with nothing, i.e. removed.) 10.1.5.1 One of the only times when whitespace matters Unlike some other languages (e.g. Python) where indentation and spacing can change the entire meaning of a program, Ruby is, generally, very permissive about how you use whitespace. You can usually use spacing according to your own taste, and Ruby will be able to make sense of your code. So, for example, whether you have spaces between arguments doesn’t matter; these two are equivalent: &quot;Raghu@Bet@ina&quot;.gsub(&quot;@&quot;, &quot;&quot;) &quot;Raghu@Bet@ina&quot;.gsub(&quot;@&quot;,&quot;&quot;) (The most common style is to have one space after each comma.) However, one situation in which whitespace does matter has to do with the parentheses around arguments: &quot;Raghu@Bet@ina&quot;.gsub(&quot;@&quot;, &quot;&quot;) # good &quot;Raghu@Bet@ina&quot;.gsub (&quot;@&quot;, &quot;&quot;) # bad! Can you spot the difference? Don’t put a space between the method and the opening parenthesis. It’s a very easy mistake to make, so I just wanted to warn you early on so you that can begin developing good muscle memory. Try the bad version in your sandbox and see what the error message looks like: Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.1.5.2 Seriously: please read the error message Programming boils down to: Forming a plan of what you want to do (e.g. “I want to remove any ’@’s in this input.”) Typing some code to try and do it. It never works the first time. Seeing an error message. Learning how to deal with that particular error message. The next time you encounter that error message, it will be vaguely familiar and it will take slightly less time to debug it. After you’ve encountered that error message for the 25th time, you will debug it instantly. Your skill level as a programmer is essentially the number of error messages that you have encountered in the past and now recognize. So start paying attention to them now — we want to collect ’em all! 10.1.6 An aside: Code comments Here’s a debate that will rage until the end of time: what do you call this symbol? # Is it a number sign? Is it a pound sign? Is it a hashtag? Is it a waffle? In this text, I’m going to refer to it as an octothorpe{:target=\"_blank\"}. The octothorpe is used quite a bit in Ruby. You can see one important way in the example above, where I said # bad! after some offending code. That is known as a “code comment”. The Ruby interpreter, when it sees the #, will ignore it and everything that comes after it; allowing us to leave notes to ourselves and to each other. Use comments liberally. Another nice trick is: when experimenting with some code and it’s not working, just comment it out and try a different approach on the next line. That way you can keep the old code around for reference without having to delete it, but it won’t break the program. 10.1.7 Variables are boxes Now that you’ve seen arguments, you know all there is to know about crafting expressions in Ruby. No kidding: object.method(arguments) is the vast majority of what we’ll be doing. That’s it. However, so far we haven’t been doing much with the return value of each expression. We’ve just been reading it off the screen, and then dropping it on the ground. For example, try the following: # &quot;hello world&quot;.upcase # &quot;hello world&quot;.reverse Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} We’re not really able to make any forward progress when we only perform one operation at a time. Programs get interesting only when we start to take the return value of one expression and feed it into the next method. That’s how we craft our own novel, useful applications from the basic building blocks of Ruby. So: let’s start to store our return values for future reference, instead of dropping them on the ground. We do this using variables, or as I like to think of them, boxes. Let’s get our feet wet: Type the following: s = &quot;hello world!&quot;.upcase s Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} This creates a box, labels it s, and stores the string \"HELLO WORLD!\" in it. 10.1.7.1 The variable assignment operator The single equals sign, =, is called the “variable assignment operator”. When I read s = &quot;hello world!&quot;.upcase out loud, I say “the string hello world dot upcase is assigned to the variable s”. I read the right side first, because that’s how Ruby reads it too; it first evaluates the expression on the right side of the =, and then it stores the resulting value in the variable on the left. Now add another line, s = &quot;hello world!&quot;.upcase s.reverse s Great! Now we’re making progress. 10.1.7.2 Storing the next return value What would you expect to happen if you add a third line so that your program reads: s = &quot;hello world!&quot;.upcase s.reverse s.gsub(&quot;L&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) What do you think s contains now? Try it: s Did it match your expectations? Most Ruby methods don’t modify the object that they are called upon; they just return a modified copy. The original variable is untouched, so if we want to hold on to the new value then we better store that too. Type this: s = &quot;hello world!&quot;.upcase t = s.reverse u = t.gsub(&quot;L&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) u Fortunately, we can create as many variables as we want. 10.1.7.3 Updating variables It can get old coming up with different variable names for every step of the program. Instead, we usually want to re-use existing variables. We can throw away what we have in the box and put in something entirely different with the same assignment operator, =. Type this: s = &quot;hi&quot; s = 2.odd? s We can even replace the value in the box with an updated version of the old value, because the expression on the right side of the assignment operator is evaluated before the assignment takes place. Type this: s = &quot;hello, world!&quot; s = s.capitalize s = s.reverse s That may look strange — how can we use s on the left side and the right side of the =? But it’s because this is not the equals sign from math class; this is the variable assignment operator, and the right side is evaluated first until only a single value is left; and then that object is assigned into the box on the left (replacing whatever was there before). So you will very often see something like this: counter = counter + 1 When we’re keeping track of e.g. how many times we’ve printed something out on the screen. We are taking the original value of counter, adding 1 to it, and then replacing the contents of counter with that new total. 10.1.7.4 Variable syntax You may have noticed that the variable assignment syntax is a departure from the primary syntax of object.method. But we do it all day long, so we need to know it just as well. Our programs will end up looking like this (these are made-up method names, so this code won’t work): storage_box_1 = &quot;starting data&quot;.first_transformation storage_box_2 = storage_box_1.second_step storage_box_3 = storage_box_2.third_method.maybe_even(&quot;another&quot;, &quot;one&quot;) # etc for dozens or hundreds of lines First, the expression on the right side of the assignment operator will be evaluated until there are no methods left and there’s just a piece of data remaining. Then, that value will be placed in the variable named on the left side of the assignment operator, which will be created if it doesn’t exist, or will have its value replaced if it does exist. Most programs are just a long succession of statements where we do some work with object.method and store the result in some variable, then we do some more work on that variable and store the result in yet another variable, and a hundred steps later we’ve produced our final result and we display that to our user. BENP: I wonder if the previous two sections can be condensed a bit more and merged into one 10.1.7.5 Variable naming rules When you are choosing your variable names, there are some rules: Variable names can only contain lowercase letters (a..z), numbers (0..9), and underscores (_) — they can’t contain spaces. Variable names cannot begin with a number. Rubyists strive to choose descriptive variable names, no matter how long they are, so that it’s obvious to teammates what the contents are at a glance. Please avoid naming your variables x, y, and z. Use underscores to separate words in multi-word variable names, since we can’t use spaces. 10.1.8 That’s it That’s it for the fundamental grammar of Ruby! storage_box = noun.verb(input1, input2) It’s not that much worse than the calculator language, is it? Of course, there’s a bit more syntax (like how to define our own nouns and verbs) that we need to learn, but for the most part, object.method is the bulk of what we do. Now we need to spend some time expanding our vocabulary — what are the most commonly used data types in Ruby, and what are some of their methods? That’s coming up next. It is a time-honored tradition{:target=\"_blank“} that the very first thing a programmer does in a new language is print out”Hello, World!\" Congratulations — you’re now one of us ↩︎ The name “string” is used in pretty much every programming language for the datatype that holds a piece of text, and refers to a string of characters; a holdover from back when we used to have to worry about conserving the computer’s physical storage space and had a separate datatype for an individual character. Now we usually don’t have to worry about storage space anymore, but the name “string” stuck with us.↩︎ "],["a-few-program-notes.html", "10.2 A few program notes", " 10.2 A few program notes Notes: Copied from program-notes.md Before we continue, I want to pause and discuss what, why, and how we’re going to be learning. 10.2.1 What’s our goal? Our goal is to build and deploy a fully-functional application, which will require that we learn a little bit about every part of the “stack” — the interface that users interact with all the way through to the server that the application runs on. We’re going to work from the inside-out. We’ll start by learning how to manage information with a database, because that is the heart of any useful application. Then we’re going to learn how to expose an interface for users to get information in and out of our database — we’ll be starting with a web client because that’s the quickest way to get up and running, but we could add an iPhone or Android client later. 10.2.2 Why Ruby? For all of the above, we’re going to use the Ruby language. There are many languages we could have chosen, but Ruby has a lot of advantages for beginners: 10.2.2.1 Developer happiness Compared to other languages, Ruby is a pleasure to write and to read. Here’s Yukihiro Matsumoto (a.k.a. “Matz”), the creator of Ruby: Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, “By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something.” They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. — Yukihiro Matsumoto, The Philosophy of Ruby{:target=\"_blank\"} Matz’s focus when he designed Ruby was on “developer happiness”, which was pretty bold in back 1995 when Ruby was first released. Optimizing for human readability rather than computer readability meant paying a cost in terms of performance, and computers were slow back then; but Matz didn’t care. Happily, computers are very fast today8, and they can run Ruby just fine; so now we beginners can have the best of both worlds. Besides, once you’ve learned the basic concepts of programming, they’re not hard to translate into the syntax of another language9. 10.2.2.2 Ruby on Rails and other libraries People often ask “What’s the best language for task X?” Depending on the task, sometimes a language is particularly well-suited to it technically; but that is very rare. In general, any programming language can do anything that any other language can (unless maybe there is some kind of proprietary platform lock-out). However, there’s another very important consideration: which language has the largest community of developers doing task X? More community means more shared code (known as “libraries”, or in Ruby-land, “gems”), more blog posts, more answers when you Google a question, etc. For example, Python and Ruby are very similar languages in terms of their technical features and performance profile. However, by some historical accident, Python seems to have gathered more of the scientific/data analysis/machine learning community around it, so more open-source libraries in those areas have been developed and shared in Python than in Ruby; and so now Python is the go-to language for those tasks. On the other hand, for agile development of database-backed applications, Ruby has a huge and thriving community. In particular, there is an open-source library for building applications called Ruby on Rails (“Rails”, for short) that makes small teams or even solo developers incredibly productive. The existence of Rails alone makes the Ruby language a good choice10 for both startups and beginners. The philosophy of Rails is “convention over configuration” — it makes a lot of decisions on your behalf, and if you go with the flow, then things “just work”. (If you want to fiddle with settings, then of course you can, to your heart’s content; but you don’t have to spend hours or days doing so before anything will even show up, like you do in most other frameworks.) You can focus on building the unique features of your application, not on plumbing that’s common to all applications. There are a lot of other powerful, easy-to-use Ruby libraries that have philosophies similar to Rails. Ruby seems to have gathered a community of developers around it who are more about creating value for our users, and less about bike shedding{:target=\"_blank\"} over technical details11. 10.2.2.3 MINASWAN The programming world at large can be pretty competitive and harsh, but I’ve found that the Ruby community is very inclusive and welcoming, which is a relief for beginners. Maybe this can also be traced back to Matz; from his Wikipedia page{:target=\"_blank\"}, His demeanor has brought about a motto in the Ruby community: “Matz is nice and so we are nice,” commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN. 10.2.2.4 Heroku and other integrations Another way in which the ergonomics of Ruby excels is the amount of tooling that exists around it. For example, Heroku was the first “platform as a service”, a layer on top of Amazon Web Services that makes it incredibly easy to deploy applications to an industrial-grade infrastructure. Something that would have itself required a whole separate course to learn how to do, we can now do with just one click; and we can focus instead on building features for our users. Rails was the first platform that Heroku supported, and Rails developers are still Heroku’s primary users. There are many other services, everything from performance monitoring to error reporting to email delivery to A/B testing to analytics, that offer tight integrations with Ruby and/or Rails and make using them hyper-productive for small teams, solo developers, and therefore also for us beginners. 10.2.3 How are we going to go from zero to Hero(ku)? To go from complete beginner to deploying a fully functional application is quite a bit of ground to cover. Here’s how we’re going to do it: 10.2.3.1 Cloud editors As you’ve already seen, we’re going to start by writing Ruby right here in your browser. This is the lowest-friction way to get started, and will allow us to focus on learning Ruby without having to waste mental energy on installing tools. Later, if you decide to continue with software development for the long-term, you may want to install Ruby on your own computer and switch to a more powerful code editor. We’ll provide guidance on how to do that. 10.2.3.2 Make the invisible visible One of our foundational principles while programming, learning, and almost anything else, is to find a way to make the invisible visible — that is, find a way to give yourself concrete feedback on what you’re doing. Don’t guess what’s happening at each step of the program — find a way to see what’s happening, if at all possible. Feedback is crucial. 10.2.3.2.1 Printing values Let’s talk a little bit more about how the REPLs work. So far, we’ve been using IRB to run one line of Ruby at a time. But our programs will be thousands of lines long, ultimately; and we want to save them permanently into files, not type them in one line at a time. So, from now one we’ll write them in the editor at the top of the window; then we’ll run the program by clicking “run ▶” and seeing the output in the black window (known as the “terminal”) at the bottom. However, there won’t be any output unless we specifically say what we want to print into the terminal. It turns out there’s a special method in Ruby called Kernel.p (p is short for “print inspect”) that will display its argument in the terminal. Try running the following in a REPL: s = &quot;hello world!&quot;.upcase t = s.reverse u = t.gsub(&quot;L&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) Kernel.p(s) Kernel.p(t) Kernel.p(u) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Printing values to the terminal is something we’re going to want to do a lot, and so Ruby makes it easy for us; rather than having to type Kernel.p, we can just type the shorthand of p. Change Kernel.p to p above and give it a try. 10.2.3.3 Optional parentheses around arguments To make it even easier to make the invisible visible, here’s another shortcut: When we discussed Arguments{:target=\"_blank\"}, we said that they always come within parentheses. That’s not quite true. Ruby allows you to, optionally, leave out the parentheses; so the following will also work: p &quot;HELLO WORLD!&quot; And when you are roaming the internet, you will see this style often, especially with p. My advice to you is: you can drop the parentheses when you are printing, but other than that, always include them. They help to keep things clear, and they prevent order-of-operations errors. 10.2.3.4 Use p a lot I like to use p a lot while I am programming. As I said, one of my fundamental programming principles is make the invisible visible — don’t try to guess what’s going on, find a way to see what’s going on. p is an excellent tool for that, so I use p like crazy, sometimes before almost every line while I am debugging. It can be tedious to wrap every line in parentheses, and it’s convenient instead to just pop a p at the beginning of a line. So in this one case, I give you permission to omit the parentheses around arguments to a method. Enjoy! 10.2.3.5 Passing tests The REPLs that are embedded within the readings are good for experimentation and getting a feel for how things work. But we’re also going to, at the end of each reading, have a separate assignment with exercises that include automated tests. You will have to complete and rails grade to ensure comprehension. Hopefully this will surface questions — our constant goal. 10.2.4 Onwards Okay! With that housekeeping out of the way, let’s move on and learn more about the Fundamental Classes of Ruby, starting with our friend String. From a business perspective, servers are very cheap while developers are very expensive; so you should pick the language that makes developers the most productive.↩︎ If you decide to pursue software development, you’ll end up learning at least half-a-dozen languages. Whatever challenge is thrown your way, you’ll choose the right tool for the job.↩︎ Here’s a longer blog post on why Ruby on Rails is still a good choice in 2019: https://devbrett.com/2019/03/why-i-believe-rails-is-still-relevant-in-2019.html{:target=\"_blank\"}↩︎ I, personally, agree with this author who prefers boring technologies over cutting-edge ones: https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology{:target=\"_blank\"}↩︎ "],["string.html", "10.3 String", " 10.3 String Notes: Copied from string.md There is an un-transcribed video that serves as review of the Technical Setup. See Ruby Practice: String for project: https://github.com/appdev-projects/string-chapter Let’s start by getting a more formal introduction to our friend, String. First of all, notice that when I refer to Ruby classes, I capitalize the first letter. The only time we use capital letters when we’re programming is when we refer to Ruby classes. All other times — variable names, file names, etc — we’re going to use lowercase letters only (other than when we’re writing some copy inside a string, of course). 10.3.1 Creating strings We’ve actually been taking a shortcut this whole time when we’ve been saying something like s = &quot;Hello, world!&quot; In Ruby, the formal way to create a new object is to use the .new method on the parent class: s = String.new This will, however, just give us back an empty string \"\". We would then have to add each character to it one by one. One way to do so is by using the .concat method, which accepts a number as an argument, interprets it as an ASCII code, translates it into a single character, and adds it on to the end of the original string. 10.3.1.1 ASCII Codes What’s an ASCII code? At the hardware level, computers only store integers (specifically, in binary form — using only 0s and 1s); so all other datatypes need to be encoded somehow as a number. ASCII{:target=\"_blank\"}, or American Standard Code for Information Interchange, was one scheme that was developed in the early days of computing to store English characters as integers12. The codes are as follows: ASCII Code Character ASCII Code Character ASCII Code Character ASCII Code Character ASCII Code Character ASCII Code Character 32 (space) 48 0 64 @ 80 P 96 &lt;/code&gt;|112|p33|!|49|1|65|A|81|Q|97|a|113|q34|\"|50|2|66|B|82|R|98|b|114|r35|#|51|3|67|C|83|S|99|c|115|s36|$|52|4|68|D|84|T|100|d|116|t37|%|53|5|69|E|85|U|101|e|117|u38|&amp;|54|6|70|F|86|V|102|f|118|v39|’|55|7|71|G|87|W|103|g|119|w40|(|56|8|72|H|88|X|104|h|120|x41|)|57|9|73|I|89|Y|105|i|121|y42|*|58|:|74|J|90|Z|106|j|122|z43|+|59|;|75|K|91|[|107|k|123|{44|,|60|&lt;|76|L|92|` 108 l 45 - 61 = 77 M 93 ] 109 m 125 } 46 . 62 &gt; 78 N 94 ^ 110 n 126 ~ 47 / 63 ? 79 O 95 _ 111 o Given those ASCII codes, we can now build up a new string from scratch like so: my_string = String.new p my_string my_string.concat(72) my_string.concat(101) my_string.concat(108) my_string.concat(108) my_string.concat(111) my_string.concat(44) p my_string my_string.concat(32) my_string.concat(119) my_string.concat(111) my_string.concat(114) my_string.concat(108) my_string.concat(100) my_string.concat(33) p my_string Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.1.2 String literals BENP: possibly shorten section, is it necessary? What a pain! Now that we’ve shown that, under the hood, even creating a string follows the syntax of noun.verb — let’s never do it again. From now on, we’ll use the shortcut of creating string “literals” in place by typing the characters we want within quotes: \"Thank goodness!\" These kinds of exceptions to the regular grammar in order to make life easier are known as “syntactic sugar”. 10.3.2 Methods Next, let’s familiarize ourselves with some of the String class’s methods. For each method below, we’ve provided some REPLs. They are there for you to experiment with the code, click “run ▶”, or use irband see how the methods work. Keep these methods in mind when working on the assignment in Gitpod. 10.3.2.1 String addition, a.k.a. + We’ve already met the .concat method. .concat can accept an integer as an argument, which it interprets as an ASCII code, translates into a single character, and adds to the original string: &quot;hi&quot;.concat(33) # =&gt; &quot;hi!&quot; .concat can also accept a string literal as an argument, in which case it just adds the whole thing to the end of the original string. &quot;hi&quot;.concat(&quot; there&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;hi there&quot; There’s also a shorthand for .concat: .+.13 That may look a little funny, but it’s nothing special, really; it’s just a method with a very short (one letter long) name: &quot;hi&quot;.+(&quot; there&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;hi there&quot; But here’s where it gets interesting; Ruby has another bit of nice syntactic sugar for us. If a class has a method named +, then you are allowed to drop the . before the method name when you call it, and just say: BENP: this seems like a long-winded way to say you can just add strings, but I guess + comes up in other classes besides strings and integers? Is that something students can learn later in their programming life. Always trying to reduce information at the early stages here…maybe dropping the stuff about “.” in this and following section. &quot;hi&quot; +(&quot; there&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;hi there&quot; Wild! And, as we learned earlier when we were introduced{:target=\"_blank\"} to the p method, Ruby also allows you to omit the parentheses around arguments if you want to; so this can be further shortened to: &quot;hi&quot; + &quot; there&quot; # =&gt; &quot;hi there&quot; Now this is really starting to look familiar! It’s a lot like the calculator language, actually. Developer happiness{:target=\"_blank\"}, indeed. a = &quot;Hello&quot; b = &quot;World&quot; p a + b # You can add strings together Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.2.2 String multiplication, a.k.a * Strings can be multiplied by numbers using the * method14: &quot;Ya&quot; * 5 # =&gt; &quot;YaYaYaYaYa&quot; This sort of makes sense, if you think about multiplication as being repeated addition. p &quot;Hello&quot; * 3 Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} The order matters, though. See what happens when you try: 3 * &quot;Hello&quot; Read The Error Message (RTEM{:target=\"_blank\"})! Does this make sense? \"Hello\" * 3 is calling the String method * with an argument of 3, which kinda makes sense (add \"Hello\" to itself 3 times). But 3 * \"Hello\" is calling the Integer method * with an argument of \"Hello\", which doesn’t make much sense (what would it mean to add 3 to itself \"Hello\" times?). Thus, we can see why the String version of * and the Integer version of * both need an integer argument. Again, the bottom line{:target=\"_blank“} is — at all times as you are writing Ruby, you should be thinking:”What class is this object? What methods does this class have available?\" Even when there’s some syntactic sugar making things look unconventional, don’t forget your basics! It’s still noun.verb under the hood. 10.3.2.3 upcase The upcase method returns a copy of the String with all lowercase letters replaced with their uppercase counterparts. p &quot;hello&quot;.upcase Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.2.4 downcase The downcase method returns a copy of the String with all uppercase letters replaced with their lowercase counterparts. p &quot;I&#39;M NOT YELLING AT YOU&quot;.downcase Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} BENP: maybe overkill on the REPLs here, can we combine all these string methods (below as well) into one? 10.3.2.5 swapcase The swapcase method returns a copy of the String with all uppercase letters replaced with their lowercase counterparts, and vice versa. p &quot;FaMiLy&quot;.swapcase # =&gt; &quot;fAmIlY 10.3.2.6 reverse The reverse method returns a new String with the characters from the String in reverse order. p &quot;I can speak in backwords words&quot;.reverse Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.2.7 length The length method returns the number of characters (as an Integer) that a String has. p &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;.length Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.2.8 chomp The chomp method is mostly used to remove the \"\\n\" (newline) character from the end of a string, if it is present: &quot;Raghu\\n&quot;.chomp # =&gt; &quot;Raghu&quot; &quot;Raghu&quot;.chomp # =&gt; &quot;Raghu&quot; This seemingly strange task is very common due to the way that getting user input works; usually someone has to type something at a prompt and then they press return to submit it, and that adds a newline to the end of the string that they typed. Typically, we want to chomp that off the end of their input before we do anything further with it. chomp can also remove other specified character(s) from the end of the string, if they are provided as an argument: &quot;1 apples&quot;.chomp(&quot;s&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;1 apple&quot; &quot;1 apple&quot;.chomp(&quot;s&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;1 apple&quot; Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.2.9 gsub The gsub method returns a copy of the String it was called on with all occurrences of the first argument substituted for the second argument. a = &quot;Hello&quot; p a.gsub(&quot;ll&quot;, &quot;ww&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;Hewwo&quot; Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.2.9.1 Advanced gsub techniques BENP: This is pretty advanced and could be confusing to throw in here; maybe Regexp doesn’t appear here? gsub also supports accepting a regular expression as its first argument. We won’t get into regular expressions in detail right now, but all languages (C, C++, Python, etc) include a way to write regular expressions and they are a very powerful way to check whether input strings match certain patterns. In Ruby, we work with regular expressions the way we work with everything else — via a class, Regexp. We create Regexp literals with forward slashes (like we use quotes to create String literals), and then put the pattern that we’re trying to match between the slashes. For now, we’re just going to copy-paste a few simple regexes15 that come in handy with gsub, in particular: /\\s+/ matches all whitespace, so we can use it with gsub to remove all whitespace: &quot;Hello there,\\nfriend&quot;.gsub(/\\s+/, &quot;&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;Hellothere,friend&quot; /[^0-9]/ matches everything except numeric digits, so we can use it with gsub to remove everything except digits: &quot;March 29th!&quot;.gsub(/[^0-9]/, &quot;&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;29&quot; /[^a-z]/i matches everything except letters (case-insensitively), so we can use it with gsub to remove everything except letters: BENP: where is the i from in the above expression – case-insensitive? ```ruby &quot;March 29th!&quot;.gsub(/[^a-z]/i, &quot;&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;Marchth&quot; ``` /[^a-z0-9\\s]/i matches everything except letters, digits, and whitespace, so we can use it to remove everything except for those: &quot;March 29th!&quot;.gsub(/[^a-z0-9\\s]/i, &quot;&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;March 29th&quot; 10.3.2.10 to_i Sometimes you have a string that contains a number, usually input from a user, and want to do math on it. to_i will attempt to convert a String object into an Integer object. p &quot;8&quot;.to_i Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.2.11 strip strip removes all leading and trailing whitespace. p &quot; This has a lot of space on the outside &quot;.strip Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.2.12 capitalize capitalize returns a String with the first character converted to uppercase and the remainder to lowercase. p &quot;beginning&quot;.capitalize Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.2.13 split This transforms the String into an Array (a list), which we’ll read more about later. If you provide no argument, the string is split upon whitespace, which is handy for e.g. turning a sentence into a list of words: sentence = &quot;Hi I&#39;d like to learn how to program please!&quot; words = sentence.split p words Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} If you do provide an argument to .split, then the string will be chopped up wherever that argument occurs instead of whitespace — for example, use \"4,8,15,16,23,42\".split(\",\") to split on commas. BENP: Below is maybe best left off, introduces arrays and array indexing a bit early You can also split with the empty string, \"\", as an argument in order to turn a string into an Array of its individual characters: a = &quot;Hello!&quot;.split(&quot;&quot;) # =&gt; [&quot;H&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;!&quot;] a.at(0) # =&gt; &quot;H&quot; a.at(-1) # =&gt; &quot;!&quot; 10.3.2.14 include? include? takes a String argument and returns true or false if the argument exists in the String that include? is called on. p &quot;Happy Days&quot;.include?(&quot;H&quot;) p &quot;Happy Days&quot;.include?(&quot;Z&quot;) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.3.3 More on adding strings together We spend a lot of time composing strings of output for our users, so let’s see a few more examples. Try this: number = 6 * 7 message = &quot;Your lucky number for today is &quot; + number + &quot;.&quot; Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} You’ll see that Ruby gets confused (RTEM!), because we are trying to add an integer to a string and it doesn’t feel comfortable with that. The solution is to tell the Integer to convert itself to a String first using the method called .to_s, or “to string”. Try this instead: number = 6 * 7 message = &quot;Your lucky number for today is &quot; + number.to_s + &quot;.&quot; The above technique for composing strings, adding them together with +, is called string addition. There’s another technique for composing strings that I personally find a bit easier; it’s called string interpolation. Try this instead: number = 6 * 7 message = &quot;Your lucky number for today is #{number}.&quot; Basically, inside the string, you place #{} where you eventually want your value to go. Inside the curly braces, you can write any Ruby expression without worrying about whether it is a string or not. The expression will be evaluated, converted to a string, and added to the string right in that spot. You can interpolate as many expressions as you want into a single string. Pretty neat! If you find interpolation confusing, feel free to just use addition. 10.3.4 Getting strings from users with gets We can make our programs much more interesting if we allow the users of the program to interact with them by supplying input. We can do this with the gets method (pronounced “get S”, short for “get string”), which will pause the program and wait for the user to type something in the terminal and press return. The return value of the gets method will be a String containing what the user typed, which we can store in a variable and then process further like any other String. For example, rather than saying “Hello, world!”, let’s have the computer say hello to the user by name instead. When you run this program, it will pause after saying \"What's your name?\" and you will have to type something in and press return. Click on the terminal to put focus there, and then you’ll be able to type into it: p &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; their_name = gets p &quot;Hello, &quot; + their_name + &quot;!&quot; Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Great! Our first user input. However, you’ll notice a couple of things. First of all, there’s a \\n sneaking into the input. \\n represents a newline character, and it’s in there because of the return that is pressed to submit the input. 10.3.4.1 puts If you want to see the newline in action, we can use a different printing method called Kernel.puts (pronounced “put S”, short for “put string”). puts is actually the printing method that is used most when crafting the final output of command-line programs; as opposed to Kernel.p, which is used most for making the invisible visible while debugging. Try switching p &quot;Hello, &quot; + their_name + &quot;!&quot; to puts &quot;Hello, &quot; + their_name + &quot;!&quot; and see how the output is different. You can see that the quotes around the string are removed, which makes sense if you’re actually displaying output to a user and not debugging — users should not know or care about the quotes around Ruby string literals. And the newline character causes a line break when a string is printed with puts, as it should. Most of the time, we’ll stick with p, since it provides more details while debugging; but it’s good to know that puts exists. 10.3.4.2 gets.chomp We almost never want to keep the \\n that results from the return keypress that submits the user’s input. Fortunately, the handy .chomp method{:target=\"_blank\"} does exactly what we need — if there’s a \\n at the end of a string, it will remove it; if there isn’t, it does nothing. So, in practice, when we call gets we almost always tack a .chomp on to it immediately. Try modifying the program to: their_name = gets.chomp and see how it’s different. 10.3.5 Conclusion That’s about all we’ll need to know about strings to do most anything related to web applications! Next, we’ll take a look at numbers, starting with Integer. Nowadays we use much more sophisticated encoding schemes such as Unicode{:target=\"_blank\"} that supports glyphs from many more languages, and even emojis  Fortunately, Ruby handles most of this low-level stuff for us behind the scenes, so we never really have to worry about it anymore.↩︎ This is not quite true. The + method is not just an alias for concat — they do slightly different things. But they’re close enough, for our purposes.↩︎ More syntactic sugar here, like with the + method above; you can say \"Ya\" * 5 rather than \"Ya\".*(5).↩︎ If your project requires scanning text for patterns, then RegexOne{:target=\"_blank\"} is a good resource for learning more.

We’ll learn about integers first. 10.5.1 Syntax Integers begin with a digit (0-9) and end when Ruby meets anything other than a digit (a space, a comma in an array, a closing parentheses at the end of method arguments, etc) — except for underscores, which you can use as a delimiter if it helps to understand the number: 10000000 # Is this 1 million? 100 million? 10_000_000 # Ah, it&#39;s easier to tell now. 10.5.2 Methods Let’s experiment with some common methods for Integers: 10.5.3 + - * / % ** (math) We, of course, have the standard math methods, like the calculator language. These methods all have the same syntactic sugar that the String versions did, so we can say 12 + 5 rather than 12.+(5) (thankfully). Try each of the following: 12 + 5 12 - 5 12 * 5 12 / 5 Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Whoa! Did you get what you expected for that last one? It turns out that the Integer version of division will only return another Integer, and so / only returns the whole part (like in elementary school). If you want the remainder, you have to use the % (called the “modulus”) operator. Try this: 12 % 5 Another maybe unexpected thing: raising a number to a power, e.g. 32, is not done using the ^ like in many other computing environments. Instead, use the double-star ** operator: 3 ** 2 10.5.4 odd? and even? The .odd? and .even? methods return true or false based on whether the number is, well, odd or even. Don’t be thrown off by the question mark at the end of the method name — it’s nothing special, just another letter. Rubyists like to end method names with a question mark when methods return true or false. p 7.odd? Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.5.5 rand There’s another special method like p that we are allowed to call “in space”, i.e. not on the right side of a dot16, called rand. It returns a random number, and is very useful for all kinds of stuff, everything from games to statistical analysis: rand(6) # =&gt; returns a random integer between 0 and 5 Somewhat oddly, rand(n) will return a random integer between 0 and n - 1 rather than between 1 and n. That may seem surprising, but it’s actually pretty handy because a lot of times what we want to do is generate a random offset and it’s convenient for that to include 0 as a possibility. Give it a try: # random number between 0 and 8 p rand(9) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.5.6 to_s We often will want to combine our Integers with Strings when crafting output for our users. Give it a try: lucky_number = rand(100) p &quot;Your lucky number is&quot; + lucky_number Uh oh! RTEM!{:target=\"_blank\"} It turns out that String’s + method can only add two strings together, not a string and an object of some other class. So, a lot of times we’ll need to convert an Integer into a String prior to output. Fortunately Integer has a handy method, to_s (or “to string”), that does just that: p 98.to_s Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.5.7 to_f Similarly, there’s a to_f (or “to float”) method to convert an Integer to a Float, which is often handy for doing math, as we’ll see next. 10.5.8 Conclusion That’s it for Integer.

One other thing to keep in mind: you can use ** in conjunction with fractions to calculate roots, since 91/2 is the same as the square root of 9, 81/3 is the same as the cube root of 8, etc. 9 ** 0.5 # =&gt; 3.0 8 ** (1/3.0) # =&gt; 2.0 10.7.1.2 round Floats can round themselves.

The Date class isn’t loaded into every Ruby program by default, so to use it we first need to say require &quot;date&quot; (Usually we omit the parentheses around the string argument to the require method.) 10.10.1.1 Date.new After require \"date\", we can create a new instance as usual with: Date.new # =&gt; #&lt;Date: -4712-01-01 ((0j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)&gt; By default, the new date is January 1st, of the year -4712 BCE!

"],["array.html", "10.12 Array", " 10.12 Array Notes: Copied from array.md See Ruby Practice: Array for project: https://github.com/appdev-projects/array-chapter Next, we have a very important class: Array. Most of what we do as developers is manage lists of things. Lists of photos, likes, followers, reviews, listings, messages, rides, events, concerts, projects, etc etc etc. The first data type we’re going to learn to help us manage lists of things is Array. This class, unlike the ones we’ve seen until now, is really just a container for other objects, and can hold however many objects we want. 10.12.1 Creating arrays As always, we have the formal way of creating a new object in Ruby: use the .new method on the parent class: cities = Array.new Try it out and see what you get if you p cities: Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.12.1.1 push As you can see, Ruby represents an Array with square brackets, []. The brand new array is empty; let’s add some elements to it with the .push method. Try this: cities = Array.new cities.push(&quot;Chicago&quot;) cities.push(&quot;NYC&quot;) p cities cities.push(&quot;LA&quot;) # Add some of your own, if you like p cities Now we’re talking! We’ve stored multiple strings within a single array using the .push method21. Ruby separates the elements in an array with commas. 10.12.1.2 Array literals Much like with Strings, there’s a shortcut to creating Arrays. Rather than starting with Array.new and building it up from scratch one .push at a time, we can type an array “literal” directly into the code: cities = [&quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;NYC&quot;, &quot;LA&quot;] This is the technique that we’ll be using most often. 10.12.2 Methods Now let’s familiarize ourselves with some of Arrays methods. 10.12.2.1 at After adding elements to the list, the next most important thing we need to be able to do is retrieve an element back out from the list. Our first tool for doing that is .at. The .at method takes an Integer argument, which is interpreted as the position, or index, in the Array of the element that you want to retrieve. Give it a try: cities = [&quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;NYC&quot;, &quot;LA&quot;, &quot;SF&quot;, &quot;NOLA&quot;] p cities p cities.at(2) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Whoa! Did you expect cities.at(2) to return \"LA\"? I sure didn’t, the first time I tried it; I was expecting \"NYC\". It turns out that pretty much every programming language indexes the elements in an array starting at zero, not at one. So the first element is retrieved with cities.at(0), the second element with cities.at(1), etc. You’ll get used to it after a while. A couple of other things for you to experiment with: What happens when you use an index greater than the length of the array? This is our first contact with nil, an object that represents the absence of anything. When you use an index “outside” the array, you might have expected to see an error message; but instead, Ruby returns nil. What happens when you use a negative index? 10.12.2.2 at shorthand, [] There’s a shorthand for .at() which is very common, so you should be familiar with it. It’s the .[] method, so we could write: cities = [&quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;NYC&quot;, &quot;LA&quot;, &quot;SF&quot;, &quot;NOLA&quot;] p cities.[](2) # =&gt; &quot;LA&quot; You guessed it — there’s some syntactic sugar coming up. When a class has a method named .[], Ruby allows the dot to be dropped, but the method name has to then move immediately next to the object it’s being called on (no space), and the argument moves inside the method name! Altogether, this allows us to write: cities = [&quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;NYC&quot;, &quot;LA&quot;, &quot;SF&quot;, &quot;NOLA&quot;] p cities[2] # =&gt; &quot;LA&quot; Which is sort of nice. I prefer .at because I think it reads better, but feel free to use the square brackets if you like that style better. array = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3] p array[2] Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.12.2.3 first, last Since retrieving the elements at positions 0 (the first one) and -1 (the last one) is so common, there are handy shortcut methods for those: .first and .last. Give them a try. 10.12.2.4 index The .index method is sort of the inverse of .at: given an object, .index searches within the array and returns the index where it resides. Give it a try: cities = [&quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;NYC&quot;, &quot;LA&quot;, &quot;SF&quot;, &quot;NOLA&quot;] p cities.index(&quot;SF&quot;) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Some further things for you to experiment with: What will .index return if the element is present in the array more than once? What will .index return if the element is not present in the array at all? 10.12.2.5 String#split Before we proceed with more Array methods, I want to go back for a minute and talk about the .split method from the String class{:target=\"_blank\"}. This method, when called on a String, will return an Array of substrings: &quot;alice bob carol&quot;.split # =&gt; [&quot;alice&quot;, &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;carol&quot;] If you provide no argument, the string is split upon whitespace, which is handy for e.g. turning a sentence into a list of words: If you do provide an argument to .split, then the string will be chopped up wherever that argument occurs instead of whitespace — for example, use \"4,8,15,16,23,42\".split(\",\") to split on commas. You can also split with the empty string, \"\", as an argument in order to turn a string into an Array of its individual characters: a = &quot;Hello!&quot;.split(&quot;&quot;) # =&gt; [&quot;H&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;!&quot;] a.at(0) # =&gt; &quot;H&quot; a.at(-1) # =&gt; &quot;!&quot; This is particularly handy for us because it allows us to get a String of input from users with gets and then transform it into an Array for processing: p &quot;Enter a series of numbers, separated by spaces:&quot; user_string = gets.chomp user_numbers = user_string.split length = user_numbers.count p user_string p user_numbers p &quot;You entered &quot; + length.to_s + &quot; numbers.&quot; Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} We’ll be using this technique for the remainder of our test REPLs, to make things more interesting. 10.12.2.6 count .count counts how many elements are in the list, if called with no arguments. If an argument is provided, it counts how many times that argument occurs in the list. a = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3] p a.count p a.count(3) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.12.2.7 include? A thin convenience layer on top of .count, .include? will quickly tell you whether a value is present within an Array: a = [ &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; ] a.include?(&quot;b&quot;) # =&gt; true a.include?(&quot;z&quot;) # =&gt; false 10.12.2.8 exclude? Similar to .include?, but the opposite: a = [ &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; ] a.exclude?(&quot;b&quot;) # =&gt; false a.exclude?(&quot;z&quot;) # =&gt; true 10.12.2.9 reverse array = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3] p array.reverse # =&gt; [3, 23, 19, 1, 3, 8] Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.12.2.10 sort array = [12, 4, 5, 13, 56, 32] p array.sort # =&gt; [4, 5, 12, 13, 32, 56] Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.12.2.11 shuffle array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] p array.shuffle # Returns a copy of array in random order Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.12.2.12 sample array = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3] p array.sample # =&gt; Returns a single random element from the array Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.12.2.13 min a = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3] p a.min # =&gt; 1 Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.12.2.14 max a = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3] p a.max # =&gt; 23 Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.12.2.15 sum a = [8, 3, 1, 19, 23, 3] p a.sum # =&gt; 57 Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.12.2.16 join You can think of Array’s .join method as the inverse of String’s .split method: &quot;hello!&quot;.split(&quot;&quot;) # =&gt; [&quot;h&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;!&quot;] [&quot;h&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;!&quot;].join # =&gt; &quot;hello!&quot; That is, the .split method is called on a String and returns an Array of substrings; while the .join method is called on an Array (where each element must be a String) and returns a single String. You might come across a shorthand for .push, the &lt;&lt; method, known as the “shovel” operator. This allows you to write something like: cities.&lt;&lt;(&quot;Chicago&quot;) Or with the syntactic sugar that we’re very accustomed to by now: cities &lt;&lt; &quot;Chicago&quot; I personally prefer .push — I think it’s more readable — but feel free to use the shovel if you like it better.↩︎ "],["ruby-practice-array.html", "10.13 Ruby Practice: Array", " 10.13 Ruby Practice: Array Notes: Copied from project README: https://github.com/appdev-projects/array-chapter Run your Ruby file by typing ruby and then the name of the file you want to run in the Terminal.

To do this, we need to add a new grammar to our toolbox: the if/end keywords. Here’s how it looks: lucky_number = rand(100) p &quot;Your lucky number is &quot; + lucky_number.to_s + &quot;.&quot; if lucky_number.odd? p &quot;The number is odd.&quot; end Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Try running this program a few times and see how it behaves. These expressions, which conditonally run some code based on the truth or falseness of some condition, are known as conditionals or if statements. 10.14.1 The basic anatomy of if statements The anatomy of an if statement is: if condition # code that runs if the condition is true end First comes the if keyword. After the if, on the same line, comes any Ruby expression, which is evaluated until only one piece of data is left. If that final return value of condition is “truthy”, then the code on the lines between the if and end keywords is executed. If the final return value of condition is “falsy”, then the code on the lines between the if and end keywords is ignored. Either way, the program picks up execution on the next line after the end keyword and continues on. 10.14.1.1 Don’t forget the end Every if requires a matching end, and forgetting it is a very common mistake. My advice: type the end immediately after typing the if so that you don’t forget it; then worry about typing the condition, and the code that comes on the lines between the if and the end. (While you’re at it, indent the code on the lines between by two spaces so that it is visually clear what’s inside the if statement.) 10.14.2 Multibranch if statements We can also have multibranch if statements, where we specify fallback conditions to check and code to execute if the first condition is falsy: the_temp = rand(100) p the_temp if the_temp &gt; 75 p &quot;It&#39;s going to be a great day today&quot; else p &quot;Don&#39;t leave home today&quot; end Or you can have multiple conditions that get checked, one after the other: the_temp = rand(100) p the_temp if the_temp &gt; 75 p &quot;It&#39;s going to be a great day today&quot; elsif the_temp &gt; 32 p &quot;It&#39;ll be an okay day today&quot; else p &quot;Don&#39;t leave home today&quot; end Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Note that there is no space in the elsif keyword, and that there is no e in the middle of the elsif keyword. (In other languages, this construct is elseif, else if, etc; but in Ruby it’s just elsif.) The conditions are checked in top-down priority, so even if more than one is true, whichever one is first has its branch executed; the rest are ignored. If none are true, the final else fallback branch is executed; but you don’t have to have one if you don’t want one. Inside a branch of an if statement, you can have as many lines of code as you want — and you can even have whole other multi-branch if statements, if that’s what you need. Try to indent the code within each branch by two spaces, especially if you have multiple nested if statements within one another. 10.14.3 truthiness and falsiness Why did I say “truthy” and “falsy” instead of just true and false? Because many — most — Ruby expressions return values other than true or false. Any expression can appear next to an if, and some will cause the code inside the if statement to execute (these values are known as “truthy”) and some will not (these are “falsy”). In the REPL below, try replacing 1 == 1 with each of the following. Before clicking “run” for each one, ask yourself, do you expect to see the output \"The expression is truthy.\" or not? 0 \"false\" [] nil true \"\" false if 1 == 1 # Replace this with each expression. Which of them count as &quot;truthy&quot;? p &quot;The expression is truthy.&quot; else p &quot;The expression is falsy.&quot; end Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} For how many of the above did you correctly predict the output? What did you learn about what objects count as truthy and what objects count as falsy in Ruby? It turns out that only false and nil are falsy. All other objects in Ruby are truthy — even 0, \"\", and []. 10.14.4 Comparisons That said, we’ll mostly use expressions after if that return true or false. There are lot of methods that are designed to do this; we’ve seen Integer’s .odd? and .even?, but there are a lot more. For example, most classes have ways to compare instances of the class to one another: 1 &lt; 2 # &quot;1 is less than 2&quot; 2 &lt; 1 # &quot;2 is less than 1&quot; 24*365 &gt; 10000 # There are more than 10,000 hours in a year 1 == 1 # &quot;1 is equivalent to 1&quot; 1 == 2 # &quot;1 is equivalent to 2&quot; 1 &lt;= 2 # &quot;1 is less than or equal to 2&quot; 1 &gt;= 2 # &quot;1 is greater than or equal to 2&quot; 1 != 1 # &quot;1 is NOT equivalent to 1&quot; 1 != 2 # &quot;1 is NOT equivalent to 2&quot; &quot;apple&quot; &lt; &quot;banana&quot; &quot;apple&quot; &gt; &quot;banana&quot; &quot;apple&quot; == &quot;banana&quot; &quot;apple&quot; != &quot;banana&quot; 10.14.4.1 Equivalence vs assignment Note the difference between the equivalence operator — two equals signs, == — and the variable assignment operator — one equals sign, =. Mixing up the two of them is probably the most common typo programmers make: x = 2 if x = 3 p &quot;x is 3&quot; else p &quot;x is not 3&quot; end If you run the code above, what would be printed? Why? We accidentally used the assignment operator instead of the equivalence comparison, and in doing so, we set x = 3 when we meant to check if x == 3. You will  make this typo, we all do at some point — when your conditional always is going into the true branch inexplicably, let this ring a bell! 10.14.5 Combining conditions with AND and OR Finally, another handy thing to have in your toolbelt are the logical operators &amp;&amp; (AND) and || (OR). These allow you to combine expressions; try these combined expressions out below: 3.odd? &amp;&amp; 4.even? 3.odd? &amp;&amp; 4.odd? 3.even? &amp;&amp; 4.odd? 3.odd? || 4.even? 3.odd? || 4.odd? 3.even? || 4.odd? When used with if statements, this ability is very powerful: if 3.odd? &amp;&amp; 4.even? p &quot;The combined expression is truthy.&quot; end Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Basically, &amp;&amp; is stricter than ||; both comparisons have to be true in order for the whole statement to be true when combined with &amp;&amp;; either one being true is sufficient for ||. 10.14.6 Challenge Can you create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game?

Try to interpret the program yourself before you ask Ruby to. Okay, now you can click “run ▶”. Did you guess right? We start off with a blank array, numbers. If its length is less than 10 (this is true, since length is currently 0), we push a new random number into it. Once Ruby reaches the if’s end, it proceeds to the next line and continues to execute the rest of the code (whether the if’s condition was true or not). At the end of the day, numbers has one element in it and len is 1. 10.16.2 while: conditionally doing something multiple times Now, consider almost identical code, but with the if keyword swapped for a new keyword — while: numbers = Array.new while numbers.length &lt; 10 new_number = rand(100) numbers.push(new_number) end len = numbers.length p numbers p len Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} while works almost exactly like if — it evaluates the expression next to it, and if the expression is truthy, it executes the code on the lines between it and it’s end; if not, it ignores the code on the lines between it and it’s end. There is one key difference: if the condition next to a while is truthy, after we reach it’s end, the execution of the program jumps back up to the while statement. Then the condition is evaluated again. If it is still true, then the code inside the while statement is executed again. And then the execution of the program jumps back up to the while statement again. Etc. So in this case, The first time we reach the end, we jump back up to the while. Evaluate a.length &lt; 10 again — still true, since 1 &lt; 10. So we push in another random number, and jump back up. 2 &lt; 10? Yep, so we do it again. We push in another random number, and jump back up. 3 &lt; 10? Yep, so we do it again. 4 &lt; 10? Yep, so we do it again. Etc. 10 &lt; 10? Nope, so now proceed to the line after the end and continue. And len ends up being 10. What we’ve seen here is our very first loop; code that is executed multiple times. It could be an arbitrary number of times, perhaps even an infinite number of times if we aren’t careful. 10.16.3 Blocks Fundamentally, all looping is implemented with while; but, this being Ruby, there are all sorts of convenience methods on top to make it as easy as possible to create loops for various contexts. For example, let’s say I wanted to print: &quot;1 Mississippi&quot; &quot;2 Mississippi&quot; &quot;3 Mississippi&quot; # etc &quot;10 Mississippi&quot; exactly 10 times. I could do it using while like this; try interpreting the following code before you click “run”: mississipis = 1 while mississipis &lt;= 10 p mississipis.to_s + &quot; Mississippi&quot; mississipis = mississipis + 1 end Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Does the code make sense to you?22 Or, rather than while, I could use Integer’s .times method, like this: mississipis = 1 10.times do p mississipis.to_s + &quot; Mississippi&quot; mississipis = mississipis + 1 end Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Notice there’s a new keyword here: do. This is because the .times method, in order to do its job of executing some code 10 times, needs a special argument — the code to execute. In order to pass a method some lines of code as an argument, we need to wrap the lines of code within the do and end keywords, creating what’s called a block of code. So, given a block of code, the 10.times method will execute it for us exactly 10 times; this saves us the trouble of writing a condition for while. 10.16.3.1 Block variables But the .times method will save us even more trouble than that; we can stop worrying about creating and incrementing the counter variable, mississipis, too. The .times method will create a block variable and assign values to it for us automatically, but we have to choose a name for it using some new syntax after the do: the vertical bars, | |, or “pipes”. It looks like this: 10.times do |mississipis| p mississipis.to_s + &quot; Mississippi&quot; end Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Try running it. Here’s what’s going on: We created a block of code with do/end and gave it to .times. We chose a name for a block variable, mississipis, with the | | after the do. Behind the scenes, the .times method did mississipis = 0 before the first iteration. The .times method executed the block of code the first time. Behind the scenes, the .times method did mississipis = 1 before the second iteration. The .times method executed the block of code the second time. Etc. Why does .times start by assigning 0 to its block variable during the first iteration, rather than 1? Well, that’s just how the author of the .times method made it work. BENP: isn’t the reason for starting at 0 because of 0-indexing? If so, this is a good place to reiterate that. Fortunately, Ruby provides lots of other looping convenience methods that we can take advantage of instead, and each one assigns different values to its block variable. In the REPL above, replace 10.times with each of the following and play around with the arguments to get a sense of how each method works: 5.upto(10) 99.downto(90) 1.step(10, 3) 10.step(1, -4) If the line mississipis = missippis + 1 looks a little odd to you, you’re not alone. Remember, this is variable assignment{:target=\"_blank\"}, not equivalence. So the expression on the right side (mississipis + 1) is evaluated first until there’s just one object (e.g 2) left; and then that object replaces the contents of the variable (mississipis) named on the left.

"],["each.html", "10.18 Each", " 10.18 Each Notes: Copied from each.md See Ruby Practice: Each for project: https://github.com/appdev-projects/each-chapter When we met the Array class, we noted that most of what we do as developers is manage lists of things — photos, likes, followers, reviews, listings, messages, rides, events, concerts, projects, etc etc etc — and Array is the data structure that we’ll most commonly use to contain these lists. Therefore, the most common reason we’ll have to write loops is to visit each element in an Array and do something interesting with it — for example, display the element to the user with some formatting around it. 10.18.1 Iterating over arrays with Integer’s times method Try transforming the words in an Array using what you’ve learned so far about loops{:target=\"_blank\"}: Write a program that, given a list of words from the user, would take each word and print it in three forms: Capitalized Reversed Upcased For example, for the input: apple banana orange Your program should output the following: &quot;Apple&quot; &quot;elppa&quot; &quot;APPLE&quot; &quot;Banana&quot; &quot;ananab&quot; &quot;BANANA&quot; &quot;Orange&quot; &quot;egnaro&quot; &quot;ORANGE&quot; Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} After you’ve got it working, examine the model solution here{:target=\"_blank\"}. You’ll see that I chose to use .times for this job. On Line 6, we count the length of the array. On Line 8, we use that length with the .times method to kick off a loop with the correct number of iterations. Within the block, we use the block variable (which we named the_index) to access the correct element within the array. Using .times to iterate over an Array is not bad at all, especially because .times’s block variable starts at 0, just like array indexing does. Using .times is certainly cleaner than using while, where we would have to create and increment a counter variable ourselves, and then write a condition to make sure that the loop stops after the correct number of iterations (the length of the array). 10.18.2 Array’s each method But we can do even better than using Integer’s .times method to iterate over an Array. There’s a method that you can call directly on the Array itself called .each. Compare the code below to the model solution above and try to find the differences: p &quot;Enter at least 2 words, separated by spaces:&quot; user_words = gets.chomp.split p &quot;user_words:&quot; p user_words user_words.each do |the_word| p the_word.capitalize p the_word.reverse p the_word.upcase end Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Click “run” and verify that both programs do the same thing. Nice! .each has two clear benefits over using .times: We don’t need to count the length of the array; .each does it for us and will take care of looping for the correct number of iterations. The block variable, rather than containing an integer that we can use to access the correct element, will contain the element itself. So now when we name the block variable, we should choose a name23 that reflects what each element in the list is. .each will, behind the scenes, pull the correct element out of the array before each iteration begins and assign it to that block variable. Then, we just use that variable directly, and we don’t have to worry about accessing the array with .at. The hardest part, I think, is getting your head around the block variable; in this case, |the_word|. It takes some practice. Try to remember that it’s just a name that we make up, and .each takes care of putting each element in that variable for us behind the scenes. I could have called it zebra if I wanted to; there’s nothing special about the name — in particular, it doesn’t have to match the name of the variable containing the array. Just try to pick something descriptive of an individual element in the list. 10.18.3 Sneak peek Just a sneak peek as to why .each is so important to get comfortable with: soon, you’ll be embedding Ruby loops in your web applications to create dynamic, data-driven pages with code that looks something like this: &lt;% newsfeed_photos.each do |the_photo| %&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;%= the_photo.image_source %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;%= the_photo.caption %&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; Code like this is what drives the dozens of dynamic applications you interact with on a daily basis — we pull a list of records from a database table, then we loop over them, and then we format each one using some markup language (in this case HTML for the browser, but it could be XML for native apps, etc). 10.18.4 each_with_index BENP: I also used to teach enumerate in my python class, but I found it was better to drop this and explain it later if/when necessary (i.e., after the students get very comfortable with loops on arrays). I suggest possibly striking this section… and making sure it doesn’t appear in assignment. There are some rare cases when you are looping over an array and, within the block, you would like access to the element and its index. For example, maybe you want to print a line after every other element. You could fall back to .times in these scenarios, but there’s also another Array method that has your back: .each_with_index. It looks like this: p &quot;Enter at least 2 words, separated by spaces:&quot; user_words = gets.chomp.split p &quot;user_words:&quot; p user_words user_words.each_with_index do |the_word, the_index| p the_word.capitalize p the_word.reverse p the_word.upcase if the_index.odd? p &quot;=&quot; * 20 end end Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} As you can see, some methods provide more than one block variable. .each_with_index allows you to name two variables within the pipes; the first one will receive the element, and the second one will receive the index of the iteration. Within the block you can use both variables as you see fit. In rare cases, handy. I like to name the variables that contain arrays plurally (e.g. photos), and block variables singularly (e.g. photo) to make it clear to myself which is which — the list itself versus one element within the list. Whatever you do, don’t name the block variable plurally — that’s very confusing when you come back to your code later and have to make sense of it.↩︎ "],["ruby-practice-each.html", "10.19 Ruby Practice: Each", " 10.19 Ruby Practice: Each Notes: Copied from project README: https://github.com/appdev-projects/each-chapter Run your Ruby file by typing ruby and then the name of the file you want to run in the Terminal.

In some situations, another structure is a better tool for the job: Hash. Suppose we have instructors and students: instructors = [&quot;Raghu&quot;, &quot;Logan&quot;, &quot;Jelani&quot;] students = [&quot;Jocelyn&quot;, &quot;Arthur&quot;, &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Lindsey&quot;] Suppose we want add last names and roles? person1 = [&quot;Raghu&quot;, &quot;Betina&quot;, &quot;Instructor&quot;] person2 = [&quot;Jocelyn&quot;, &quot;Williams&quot;, &quot;Student&quot;] # etc p person1.at(0) + &quot; is an &quot; + person1.at(2) p person2.at(0) + &quot; is a &quot; + person2.at(2) This may suffice if the list of attributes is small, but six months later when you come back to this code, do you really want to remember which index number was last name and which was first name and which was role? Not to mention always dealing with the array-indexes-begin-with-0-and-not-1 thing in your head. There’s a better way: rather than having Arrays automatically number each piece of data, we can give them meaningful labels in a Hash. 10.20.1 A brief interlude: Symbols There is one datatype that we haven’t discussed until now that will come in handy: Symbols. Symbols are like Strings: a sequence of characters. However, Symbols follow the same rules as variable names: Cannot contain spaces. Can only contain lowercase letters, underscores, and numbers. Cannot begin with a number. Otherwise, they are just like strings, and we can use them to hold text data: &quot;hello&quot; # I am a String :hello # I am a Symbol Symbols are created by starting them off with a colon. You don’t need a closing colon, since they cannot contain spaces; Ruby can figure out where they end. Strings are usually used to contain copy for the user or input from the user; whereas Symbols are mostly used when we, the developers, need to label something internally in our code. That’s why they can’t contain spaces, etc; we’re not going to use them to hold user input. Accordingly, Symbols don’t have as many methods for transforming their contents, like .reverse. So, that’s that. Symbols are lightweight strings that we, the developers, use when we need to label things. Let’s continue. 10.20.2 Creating hashes and storing values Back to the problem of storing a list of attributes about a person effectively, without mixing them up. Hashes are like Arrays, except each cell isn’t automatically numbered — we get to label each cell ourselves. So instead of representing a person with an Array like [\"Raghu\", \"Betina\", \"Instructor\"], we instead can use a Hash like this: BENP: Here would be a good place to explain the dictionary analogy for what hashes kind of do? person1 = Hash.new p person1 person1.store(:first_name, &quot;Raghu&quot;) p person1 person1.store(:last_name, &quot;Betina&quot;) p person1 person1.store(:role, &quot;Instructor&quot;) p person1 p person1.fetch(:role) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank“}{:target=”_blank\"} Click “run” and see what it looks like to build up a Hash. A few things to note: Ruby represents a Hash with curly brackets, {}, as opposed to the square brackets ([]) of an Array. We use the .store method to add elements to a Hash, as opposed to the .push method of Array. The .store method takes two arguments, not one: the first argument is the label, or key to store the element under; and the second argument is the piece of data itself, or the value. Ruby represents each key/value pair by separating them with a =&gt;, known as a “hash rocket”24. As in Arrays, elements in the list (each element is one key/value pair) are separated by commas. If the key already exists when you try to .store something under it, its value will be replaced. 10.20.3 fetch To retrieve a piece of data from a Hash, we use the .fetch method (as opposed to Array’s .at): person1 = Hash.new person1.store(:first_name, &quot;Raghu&quot;) person1.store(:last_name, &quot;Betina&quot;) person1.store(:role, &quot;Instructor&quot;) p person1.fetch(:last_name) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Beautiful! Now we don’t have to remember that position number 1 is last name, position number 2 is role, etc. We can retrieve objects from the list using meaningful labels instead. Let’s put it all together with multiple Hashes: person1 = Hash.new person1.store(:first_name, &quot;Raghu&quot;) person1.store(:last_name, &quot;Betina&quot;) person1.store(:role, &quot;Instructor&quot;) person2 = Hash.new person2.store(:first_name, &quot;Jocelyn&quot;) person2.store(:last_name, &quot;Williams&quot;) person2.store(:role, &quot;Student&quot;) p person1.fetch(:first_name) + &quot; is a &quot; + person1.fetch(:role) p person2.fetch(:first_name) + &quot; is a &quot; + person2.fetch(:role) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} A few things to try: What happens when you try to .fetch using a String like \"role\"? What happens when you try to .fetch using a key that doesn’t exist, like :middle_name? Get used to those error messages. You’re going to see them a lot. 10.20.3.1 fetch fallback Sometimes you may want to call .fetch using a key that may not be present in the Hash, and you don’t want the program to crash with the “key not found” error message. In that case, you can provide a second argument which will be used as a fallback return value: person1 = Hash.new person1.store(:first_name, &quot;Raghu&quot;) person1.store(:last_name, &quot;Betina&quot;) person1.store(:role, &quot;Instructor&quot;) p person1.fetch(:first_name, &quot;None provided&quot;) p person1.fetch(:middle_name, &quot;None provided&quot;) Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} 10.20.4 Hash literals Like String and Array, there’s a shortcut to creating Hashes: rather than formally instantiating a new Hash with Hash.new and then building it up from scratch one key/value pair at a time with .store, you can type out the hash literal directly into your code: person1 = { :first_name =&gt; &quot;Raghu&quot;, :last_name =&gt; &quot;Betina&quot;, :role =&gt; &quot;Instructor&quot; } person2 = { :first_name =&gt; &quot;Jocelyn&quot;, :last_name =&gt; &quot;Williams&quot;, :role =&gt; &quot;Student&quot; } Like with String and Array, this is the style that we’re going to use the vast majority of the time. In particular, Hashes are very often used as the arguments to methods, because they let us pass in a list of inputs with nice labels. When we get to Ruby on Rails, especially, we will very often type hash literals directly into the parentheses of method arguments, things like: Movie.where({ :title =&gt; &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; }) 10.20.5 fetch shorthand, [] Much like Array’s shorthand for .at{:target=\"_blank\"}, Hash also a shorthand for retrieving elements with .fetch: .[] (and the associated syntactic sugar). So we could write: person1 = { :first_name =&gt; &quot;Raghu&quot;, :last_name =&gt; &quot;Betina&quot;, :role =&gt; &quot;Instructor&quot; } p person1[:last_name] However, unlike with Array, Hash’s .[] method and .fetch method do not do the exact same thing. Experiment with them and see if you can find the difference: person1 = { :first_name =&gt; &quot;Raghu&quot;, :last_name =&gt; &quot;Betina&quot;, :role =&gt; &quot;Instructor&quot; } p person1.fetch(:last_name) p person1[:last_name] Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} Were you able to find the difference between the two methods? Hash’s .[] method, when used with a key that is not present in the hash, returns nil rather than throwing an error. I personally prefer getting the descriptive error message if the key is not present in the hash, because it means that I probably made a typo or some other mistake, and I prefer being alerted to that fact rather than the program proceeding quietly only to fail elsewhere. In the rare case that it should be possible for a key to be optionally present in a hash, then I can use a fallback second argument to .fetch, as described above. That said, out on the internet, using .[] is the most prevalent style of accessing hashes, so you should be familiar with it. But in this text, I will stick with .fetch. 10.20.6 store shorthand, []= Similar to the shorthand for .fetch above, there’s a shorthand for .store: []= person1 = Hash.new person1[:first_name] = &quot;Raghu&quot; person1[:last_name] = &quot;Betina&quot; person1[:role] = &quot;Instructor&quot; p person1 # =&gt; { :first_name =&gt; &quot;Raghu&quot;, :last_name =&gt; &quot;Betina&quot;, :role =&gt; &quot;Instructor&quot; } This syntactic sugar makes it feel like we’re doing variable assignments to keys within the Hash, but under the hood it’s identical to .store(:key, :value). 10.20.7 Use .keys to explore A very important method to use when you’re dealing with Hashes that you didn’t create yourself is .keys: h = { &quot;a&quot; =&gt; 100, &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 200, &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 300, &quot;d&quot; =&gt; 400 } h.keys #=&gt; [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;] h.fetch(&quot;b&quot;) # =&gt; 200 The .keys method returns an Array showing all of the keys that are present in the Hash, so that we know what we can .fetch. This helps tremendously when dealing with a data structure that we didn’t create ourselves, especially when it’s deeply nested (a hash containing arrays which might contain other hashes, etc). 10.20.8 keys can be anything The keys in a Hash can be any class — String, Integer, whatever — but we almost always use Symbols as keys to our Hashes. (I like using symbols as the keys simply because since the values are usually strings, syntax highlighting makes keys stand out from values in our code.) 10.20.9 values can be anything Similarly, the value stored under a key can be an object of any class. This means that you can have a Hash that contains an entirely separate Hash or Array object. Take this example: dictionary = { :colors =&gt; [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;], :person =&gt; { :name =&gt; &quot;Jenna Parker&quot;, :age =&gt; 32 } } In order to retrieve the value \"green\" from this Hash, we first need to access the Array under the key :colors. colors_array = dictionary.fetch(:colors) # =&gt; [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;] Now we can access the value at the second position with .at: colors_array.at(1) # =&gt; &quot;green&quot; Similarly, to retrieve 32 from the Hash, we first need to access the inner Hash under the key :person. person_hash = dictionary.fetch(:person) # =&gt; { :name =&gt; &quot;Jenna Parker&quot;, :age =&gt; 32 } Once the inner Hash has been retrieved, we can access the value stored under :age using fetch: person_hash.fetch(:age) # =&gt; 32 10.20.10 key The .key method is sort of the inverse of .fetch: given an object, .key searches through each value in the hash and returns the key where it resides or nil if it doesn’t exist in the hash. h = { &quot;a&quot; =&gt; 100, &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 200, &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 300, &quot;d&quot; =&gt; 400 } h.key(100) #=&gt; &quot;a&quot; h.key(200) #=&gt; &quot;b&quot; h.key(300) #=&gt; &quot;c&quot; h.key(400) #=&gt; &quot;d&quot; h.key(500) #=&gt; nil 10.20.11 The bottom line Arrays are very useful for storing a list of things that are all basically the same, and for lists that are of unknown length, and so it’s nice for Ruby to automatically number them for you. But when you are storing a list of things that are categorically different from one another and you’d rather label them yourself, then Hashes are a better choice. That’s about it!

We can define our own class to represent people with the class keyword: class Person end Remember, the only time we use capital letters in Ruby is when we’re referring to classes — and this goes for when we’re naming our own classes, too. So class person will not work. If you have a multi-word name, then CamelCase it — class VeryImportantPerson. And we can declare what attributes a person can have with the attr_accessor keyword: class Person attr_accessor :first_name attr_accessor :last_name attr_accessor :role end And now the Person class is a first-class citizen in the language, just like Array and Hash. Compare the code below to the code above for creating Arrays and Hashs to store information: class Person attr_accessor :first_name attr_accessor :last_name attr_accessor :role end c = Person.new c.first_name = &quot;Raghu&quot; c.last_name = &quot;Betina&quot; c.role = &quot;Instructor&quot; p c.last_name # =&gt; &quot;Betina&quot; p c.role p c.class # =&gt; Person Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} For each attribute that we declared, we get methods that we can call to assign and retrieve values. 10.22.1.1 Defining instance methods There are a few reasons I like using classes more than Hashes to model things, but here is the big one: in addition to just storing a list of attributes about a thing, we can also define our own methods with the def keyword. For example, try adding the following full_name method to the class we defined in the REPL above: class Person attr_accessor :first_name attr_accessor :last_name def full_name return self.first_name + &quot; &quot; + self.last_name end end Now, in addition to being able to store data (first and last names), I can ask any Person to compute its full name: hs = Person.new hs.first_name = &quot;Homer&quot; hs.last_name = &quot;Simpson&quot; &quot;Hello, &quot; + hs.full_name + &quot;!&quot; # =&gt; &quot;Hello, Homer Simpson!&quot; Two new keywords to note: I used the return keyword to signify what value I wanted to replace hs.full_name in the original expression after it’s been evaluated. I used the self keyword to refer to the object who was asked to calculate its full name, since I can’t know in advance what (if any) variable name will be used. Here’s a slightly more involved example: class Person require(&quot;date&quot;) # We need to pull in the Date class, which is not loaded by default attr_accessor :birthdate def age dob = Date.parse(self.birthdate) now = Date.today age_in_days = now - dob age_in_years = age_in_days / 365 return age_in_years.to_i end end Now every Person that we create will have the ability to compute their age based on their own dob attribute: hs = Person.new hs.birthdate = &quot;April 19, 1987&quot; hs.age # =&gt; 32, as of this writing Note that we had to require(\"date\")25 in order to load the Date class into the program; Ruby doesn’t load this class into every program by default, like it does with the core classes (String, Integer, etc). So, rather than using a Hash to model real world things, it’s a good idea to create classes, and then empower them with behavior (methods) in addition to information. 10.22.1.2 Defining class methods The methods full_name and age above are known as instance methods, because we call them on individual instances of the Person class (Homer, Mickey, Minnie, etc). We can also define class-level methods, that we call directly on Person itself. This can be handy if we want to define re-usable utility methods that don’t really belong to any one individual person. Here’s an example similar to Date.parse — what if we wanted users of the Person class to quickly be able to create new instances of the class like this: Person.parse(&quot;Betina, Raghu&quot;) # =&gt; should return a new person with first # and last name attributes already populated Then, we can define the class-level method parse, called directly on Person, like this: class Person attr_accessor :first_name attr_accessor :last_name def Person.parse(last_comma_first) last_first_array = last_comma_first.split(&quot;,&quot;) the_last_name = last_first_array.at(0).strip the_first_name = last_first_array.at(1).strip a_new_person = Person.new a_new_person.first_name = the_first_name a_new_person.last_name = the_last_name return a_new_person end end The new things to note in the code above: When defining the method, we do def Person.parse rather than just def parse to make it a class method rather than an instance method. That way, we call the method directly on capital-P Person. We give the method the ability to accept an argument by adding parentheses and choosing a name for the argument when defining the method. Then we can use the input within the method definition, sort of like how we use a block variable. 10.22.2 Inheritance When you define new classes, you can choose to inherit all the power of a “parent” class, and then add some custom behavior: class Instructor &lt; Person attr_accessor :role end class Student &lt; Person attr_accessor :grade end Instructors and Students can do everything people can, and a little bit more. Creating the first individual instance of the Instructor class: person1 = Instructor.new person1.first_name = &quot;Raghu&quot; person1.last_name = &quot;Betina&quot; person1.role = &quot;Lecturer&quot; Creating the second individual instance of the Instructor class: person2 = Instructor.new person2.first_name = &quot;Arjun&quot; person2.last_name = &quot;Venkataswamy&quot; person2.role = &quot;Faculty Coach&quot; Creating the first individual instance of the Student class: person3 = Student.new person3.first_name = &quot;Trenton&quot; person3.last_name = &quot;Arthur&quot; person3.grade = &quot;A&quot; Creating the second individual instance of the Student class: person4 = Student.new person4.first_name = &quot;Tom&quot; person4.last_name = &quot;Besio&quot; person4.grade = &quot;Incomplete&quot; Now we can use them: person1.full_name # =&gt; &quot;Raghu Betina&quot; person1.role # =&gt; &quot;Lecturer&quot; person2.full_name # =&gt; &quot;Arjun Venkataswamy&quot; person2.role # =&gt; &quot;Faculty Coach&quot; person3.full_name # =&gt; &quot;Trenton Arthur&quot; person3.grade # =&gt; &quot;A&quot; person4.full_name # =&gt; &quot;Tom Besio&quot; person4.grade # =&gt; &quot;Incomplete&quot; What would happen if I tried doing person4.role? How about person1.grade? Why? What would the error message be? Try defining all of the above and give it a shot in a REPL: class Person end class Instructor end class Student end Click here for a REPL to try it.{:target=\"_blank\"} The parentheses are almost always dropped after require.↩︎ "],["ruby-practice-our-own-classes.html", "10.23 Ruby Practice: Our own classes", " 10.23 Ruby Practice: Our own classes Notes: Copied from project README: https://github.com/appdev-projects/our-own-classes-chapter Run your Ruby file by typing ruby and then the name of the file you want to run in the Terminal.

Great! However, if we (the developers) are the only ones that can run these programs (from the command line through the ruby interpreter), then they aren’t much use. It’s time to start adding a web interface on top of our Ruby programs so that external users can interact with and benefit from them. "],["specs.html", "12.1 Specs", " 12.1 Specs For an application that runs on a server and transmits information across the internet, the interface consists of a set of URLs that a user can visit. Each URL will either display a page with some information (“get” in HTTP terminology) trigger the storing of some information (“post” in HTTP terminology) trigger the deleting of some information (“delete” in HTTP terminology) trigger the updating of some information (“patch” in HTTP terminology) forward to another URL or some combination of the above Most obviously, the user might be visiting the URLs in their browser by typing into the address bar or clicking on links. Or, more and more commonly, users might be visiting from native iPhone or Android apps without even knowing that, behind the scenes, they are visiting URLs to store and retrieve the information they need. But make no mistake: if there is information being stored in a central database, then there’s a web server running somewhere and URLs are being visited with each action a user takes. You can fully specify a web application by listing out the URLs that users can visit, and what happens when each URL is visited. For example, let’s say we wanted to build an interactive game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The complete specifications (or specs, for short) for this app might look like this: http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/rock — Should display “You played rock.”, a random move by the computer, and the outcome. http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/paper — Should display “You played paper.”, a random move by the computer, and the outcome. http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/scissors — Should display “You played scissors.”, a random move by the computer, and the outcome . http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/ — A welcome page that displays “Happy Monday!” (or whatever day it is). The rules of the game. For example, Happy Tuesday! Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper. Point your browser at /rock, /paper, or /scissors to play the game. Now — how do we get our web server to perform the above tasks when users visit the above URLs? Ensure that your rails server is running and then try pointing your browser at http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock. Right now, you should see a “No route matches error.” Let’s fix that. "],["routing.html", "12.2 Routing", " 12.2 Routing The key is: we need to connect a visit to a URL by a user to a Ruby method that will perform the desired work and send back a response. We do this by defining routes in a very special file, config/routes.rb, which is included in every Rails app. Here’s an example routes.rb with two routes defined in it: # /config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;homepage&quot; }) end 12.2.1 Route All of our routes must be contained within the block following Rails.application.routes.draw. A new Rails app will already come with this code pre-written in routes.rb. Each route is comprised of the get method26 and its two arguments: The first argument to get is a String: the path that we want users to be able to visit (the path is the portion of the URL that comes after the domain name). The second argument to get is a Hash: this is where we tell Rails which method to call when a user visits the path in the first argument. (We’ll have to actually write this method in the next step, after we write the route.) The Hash must have two key/value pairs: :controller: The value for this key is what we’re going to name the class that contains the method we want Rails to call when the user visits the path. For now we’re going to default this value to \"application\" — you’ll see why in a minute. :action: The value for this key is the what we’re going to name the method itself. “Action” is the term used to refer to Ruby methods that are triggered by users visiting URLs. 12.2.2 Action If we add the first route above to our routes.rb and then type in http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/rock into the browser, the error we’ll see is: The action &#39;play_rock&#39; could not be found for ApplicationController This is good! That means we defined the route correctly. If you still see a “No route matches” error, then double-check your route syntax and get that error to go away before you proceed further. Now we have to define a method called play_rock within a class called ApplicationController, since that’s what we specified as the value for the :action key back in our route. You can find the class in the app/controllers/ folder, and add the method within: class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock end end At the end of the day, the job of an action is to send back a response to the user. A response can be either: Rendering some data, in any one of many formats: Plain text. JSON for an application to consume — we’ve seen JSON before (in APIs), and consumed it ourselves with our Ruby scripts. HTML for their browser to draw — we’ll learn this soon. Less commonly, any other format: CSV, PDF, XML, etc. Or, the action can forward the user to another URL. This is known as redirecting. We get a method for each of these two: render for the first, and redirect_to for the second. 12.2.2.1 redirect_to Let’s try redirect_to first: class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock redirect_to(&quot;https://www.google.com&quot;) end end Now visit /rock in your browser and see what happens. As you can see, the argument to redirect_to is a String which contains some URL that you want the user to simply be forwarded to. This will come in handy later when, for example, we want to send the user directly back to a list of all photos after they’ve deleted a photo. 12.2.2.2 render More commonly, however, we’ll use render to send some data to the user’s browser for display: class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock render({ :plain =&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot; }) end end The argument to render is a Hash that specifies how we want to send the data back. We have a lot of options to choose from, corresponding to how many different formats there are in use for transmitting data. :plain is just going to send back plain text, which is enough for us for now. Try visiting /rock in your browser and you should now see a response rather than an error message. Congratulations! You’ve wired up your very first route; prepare to do it a million more times, because all developers do all day is pick the next spec , wire up the route for the URL so that a user can visit it, and then implement the logic to send back the correct information. Let’s go ahead and implement the logic for /rock. You can write as much Ruby as you need to in the method prior to the render: class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock moves = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;] computer_move = moves.sample if computer_move == &quot;rock&quot; outcome = &quot;tied&quot; elsif computer_move == &quot;paper&quot; outcome = &quot;lost&quot; elsif computer_move == &quot;scissors&quot; outcome = &quot;won&quot; end full_message = &quot;You played rock. They played &quot; + computer_move + &quot;. You &quot; + outcome + &quot;!&quot; render({ :plain =&gt; full_message }) end end Now, every time you visit /rock (or refresh the page), you should see a dynamically generated page. Yay!  Get some practice at wiring up routes by implementing /paper and /scissors, similarly. Then, implement the homepage connecting the dots for the route for the path of just plain / (with nothing after the slash). Once you’ve implemented all four of the specs above, then your job is done! 12.2.3 Addendum: Rendering JSON Imagine that we wanted to build a native iPhone app that asked our server for some information; in this simple example, for a random computer move and an outcome, but in the real-world things like the local weather given a latitude and a longitude. Rather than rendering a pre-defined message in plain text, it’s usually more helpful to the iPhone developer to render the data in JSON format, so that they can parse it, easily fetch whichever values they need, and assemble their own interface. Here is some JSON that would be convenient for an external application to parse: { &quot;player_move&quot;:&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;computer_move&quot;:&quot;paper&quot;, &quot;outcome&quot;:&quot;lost&quot; } Notice that JSON uses strings as keys — this is because JavaScript doesn’t have the equivalent of Ruby’s Symbol class. Also, there are no hash rockets; JSON just uses colons to separate keys and values. Fortunately, just as it was easy for us to convert a String containing JSON into Ruby Arrays/Hashes using the JSON.parse method, it is also easy for us to go in the other direction: both Array and Hash have methods called .to_json. Let’s create a Ruby Hash that resembles the JSON above: response_hash = { :player_move =&gt; &quot;rock&quot;, :computer_move =&gt; &quot;paper&quot;, :outcome =&gt; &quot;lost&quot; } We can then convert this into a String in JSON format with .to_json: response_hash.to_json returns: &quot;{\\&quot;player_move\\&quot;:\\&quot;rock\\&quot;,\\&quot;computer_move\\&quot;:\\&quot;paper\\&quot;,\\&quot;outcome\\&quot;:\\&quot;lost\\&quot;}&quot; The \\\" represents double-quotes; we need the backslash, known as an “escape”, because we’re already within a double-quoted string and don’t want to terminate it. You can puts the string to see it formatted: puts response_hash.to_json displays: {&quot;player_move&quot;:&quot;rock&quot;,&quot;computer_move&quot;:&quot;paper&quot;,&quot;outcome&quot;:&quot;lost&quot;} Great! That means we can update our action if we want to send back JSON instead: class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock moves = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;] computer_move = moves.sample if computer_move == &quot;rock&quot; outcome = &quot;tied&quot; elsif computer_move == &quot;paper&quot; outcome = &quot;lost&quot; elsif computer_move == &quot;scissors&quot; outcome = &quot;won&quot; end response_hash = { :player_move =&gt; &quot;rock&quot;, :computer_move =&gt; &quot;paper&quot;, :outcome =&gt; &quot;lost&quot; } render({ :plain =&gt; response_hash.to_json }) end end Congratulations — you just built your first API endpoint!  12.2.4 Addendum: Custom Controller Files We don’t have to put all of our actions within the default ApplicationController file that comes included with any Rails app; we can add our own controllers, if we want to organize things a bit more. With an app of any non-trivial size, you’ll end up with hundreds of actions, and it can get unwieldy to put them all in one gigantic application_controller.rb. Instead, we can change our route for /rock to this: get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;game&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) Now when a user visits /rock, they will see an error uninitialized constant GameController. As we know, when Ruby says “uninitialized constant” it means “I can’t find that class”. So, what’s going on here? When we said :controller =&gt; \"game\" in the route, we told Rails to look for a class called GameController when someone visits /rock. All of the controller class names will end in ...Controller, and they will begin with whatever value we provided for the key :controller in the route. Like all Ruby classes, the name must be CamelCase (not snake_case or Some_Hybrid). So in this case, it will be GameController. The class must be defined in a Ruby file that is the snake_cased version of its name. Rails will itself use the .underscore method to figure out the name; we can try it ourselves in rails console: [2] pry(main)&gt; &quot;GameController&quot;.underscore =&gt; &quot;game_controller&quot; The Ruby file must be placed within the app/controllers/ folder. So, in this case, we create a file called app/controllers/game_controller.rb (don’t forget the .rb file extension). Finally, within this file, we define the class: class GameController &lt; ApplicationController end We inherit from ApplicationController, which in turn inherits from ActionController::Base; much like our models inherited from ActiveRecord::Base via ApplicationRecord. Our models inherited .save, .where, and a bunch of other awesome database-related methods from ActiveRecord::Base; whereas our controllers are going to inherit a bunch of methods like render, redirect_to, and a bunch of other awesome interface-related methods from ActionController::Base. Don’t forget the end that goes with the class; type it before you forget it. Move your play_rock action over from application_controller.rb into this new class. Now, when a user visits the path /rock, the “uninitialized constant” error should go away and you should see a response as before. If you still see the “unitialized constant” error, then: You named your class wrong; it must exactly match the value in routes.rb, followed by Controller (singular), and CamelCase. You named the file wrong. Try doing .underscore on a string containing the class name in rails console to figure out the correct filename. You put the file in the wrong folder. It has to be within app/controllers/. Not within, for example, app/ or app/controllers/concerns/. You forgot the .rb file extension. If you can’t find which of the above it is, try deleting what you did and paving over your work again from scratch. Sometimes you just can’t spot your own typos, and paving over is the best approach. You can make as many controllers as you like; in general, a rule of thumb is to have one controller per database table. Later we’ll use other methods, post(), etc, if we want to support requests using the other HTTP verbs.↩︎ "],["rcav-flowchart.html", "13 RCAV Flowchart", " 13 RCAV Flowchart Notes: Copied from rcav-flowchart.md Our apps are nothing more than a collection of URLs that we decide to allow users to access: mydomain.com/products mydomain.com/photos/193 mydomain.com/signin So remember: everything always starts with a route between an address we want users to be able to visit and a Ruby method that will be responsible for generating a response to the user’s browser.

If we want to allow users to visit that address, we have to add a route for it in config/routes.rb. The complete route looks like this: get(&quot;/home&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;pages&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;home&quot; }) Here’s what’s going on: A route is defined using the get() method, which has two arguments. The first argument is a String that contains the address we want to support; in this case, \"/home\". The second argument to get() is a Hash that tells Rails what to do when someone visits the address. The Hash has two keys: :controller and :action. “Controllers” contain the logic of how to respond to requests (they’re just Ruby classes). “Actions” are the actual logic that gets executed by Rails when a user visits an address (they’re just Ruby methods). The key :controller must go to the name of a Ruby class; in this case, we chose \"pages\". The key :action must go to the name of a Ruby method that we want Rails to execute when a user visits /home; in this case, we chose \"home\". This name is not required to match the route. Rails finds a match for the controller name we specified in the app/controllers folder. Files that contain controllers must always end in _controller.rb, and begin with what we said in the route would be the name of the controller; in this case, pages_controller.rb. Rails finds the Ruby class in the file. The name of the class must be CamelCased and always end in ...Controller &lt; ApplicationController. In this case, PagesController &lt; ApplicationController. Rails finds the method we specified as the action and executes it; in this case, we defined a method called home. We can write as much or as little Ruby as necessary within the action to satisfy the request — reading from APIs, doing math, whatever. Once we’ve computed the final values that should be displayed to the user, we tell Rails the name of an HTML view template to use to format the output. To do so, we use the render() method. The complete render() method looks like this: render({ :template =&gt; &quot;page_templates/home.html.erb&quot;}) Here’s what’s going on: render() takes one argument, a Hash. The Hash must have a key, :template, with a String value. The string specifies the location of an Embedded Ruby HTML template to use to format the output. The first part of the string specifies the name of a folder, in this case pages_templates and the second part of the string specifies the name of a file, in this case home.html.erb. We have to create a folder within app/views that matches the name that we specified in the render() statement. We have to create a file within that folder that matches the name that we specified in the render() statement. Finally, if we’ve connected all the dots correctly, Rails will embed the variables in the .html.erb template, produce a final plain .html file, and send it back to the user’s browser. Hurray! If you didn’t connect the dots correctly, you will usually see a very descriptive error message; try to read and understand it. Some things to keep in mind: Capitalization (all file, folder, method, variable, and symbol names should be snake_case; only class names are CamelCase). Spelling/pluralization matters (by convention, controller names are usually plural, but don’t have to be). Location (controller files must be in app/controllers/). READ THE ERROR MESSAGE! It usually tells you exactly what is going wrong, and where. It will at least give you a strong hint.

We’re now especially proficient in writing Ruby programs, especially with the aid of gems and APIs. BENP: have we discussed gems and APIs up to this point though? However, if we (the developers) are the only ones that can run these programs (from the command line through the ruby interpreter), then they aren’t much use. It’s time to start adding a web interface on top of our Ruby programs so that external users can interact with and benefit from them. We already have all the tools to build our first dynamic web application. BENP: need to clearly define RCAV early in any video or document now so we aren’t left wondering, added next sentence. Before we begin building, we need to understand the URL request lifecycle of Route, Controller, Action, View (RCAV). Let’s recall that Software as a Service (SaaS) has eaten the world. What does this mean? For an application that runs on a server and transmits information across the internet, the interface consists of a set of URLs that a user can visit. People can type in a URL, click a link, or submit a form, and then get back some information relevant and valuable to them. Each URL will either display a page with some information (“get” in HTTP terminology) trigger the storing of some information (“post” in HTTP terminology) trigger the deleting of some information (“delete” in HTTP terminology) trigger the updating of some information (“patch” in HTTP terminology) forward to another URL or some combination of the above Our goal was to demistify what happens between the user action and the return of information. Now we have the vocabulary to talk about this. The world turns around the humble Uniform Resource Locator, or URL. Most obviously, the user might be visiting the URLs in their browser by typing into the address bar or clicking on links. Or, more and more commonly, users might be visiting from native iPhone or Android apps without even knowing that, behind the scenes, they are visiting URLs to store and retrieve the information they need. When somebody puts that URL into the address bar, and something happens between the URL and the page being rendered, we now can say what that is. When a user visits a URL, they are actually triggering a specific Ruby method. But make no mistake: if there is information being stored in a central database, then there’s a web server running somewhere and URLs are being visited with each action a user takes. In the background somewhere, there is an object and method and somebody is saying Something.something, and that method is actually going to do the work of drawing the correct page of information with exactly the right information for that user and outputting it in the right format (almost alway HTML). So our job is to write those Ruby methods (called “actions”) and allow users to trigger those methods when they visit each URL. So we can write any Ruby we want in those action methods. We can generate random numbers, read from APIs, calculate things, send text messages, and more. But every action must do one of two things: Render a response, by sending back some HTML and displaying a new page Redirect, or forward the user onward to another URL. And that’s everything that happens between the user visiting a URL and getting a response, and it is now a complete Route + Controller + Action + Response request lifecycle. We map every URL to one Ruby method that we write in advance and then we wire everything together so that Rails will listen for user visits and when someone visits a particular URL, then Rails will call the method we prepared that will handle getting the database information and wrapping it in bootstrapped markup and sending the HTML to the user’s browser. You can fully specify a web application by listing out the URLs that users can visit, and what happens when each URL is visited. For example, let’s say we wanted to build an interactive game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The complete specifications (or specs, for short) for this app might look like this: http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/rock — Should display “You played rock.”, a random move by the computer, and the outcome. http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/paper — Should display “You played paper.”, a random move by the computer, and the outcome. http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/scissors — Should display “You played scissors.”, a random move by the computer, and the outcome . http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/ — A welcome page that displays “Happy Monday!” (or whatever day it is). The rules of the game. For example, Happy Tuesday! Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper. Point your browser at /rock, /paper, or /scissors to play the game. Now — how do we get our web server to perform the above tasks when users visit the above URLs? 14.1.1 Potential Quiz Question First bullet point is the question itself?

Routes are how to connect a URL to an action. The very important file config/routes.rb contains all of our routes. This is a list of everything our application can do. We’re moving out of our public/ and tasks/ folder, and using more of our Rails application, by working in the app/ folder, where most of our code goes, and with this one file routes.rb that is in the config/ folder. The super important config/routes.rb file included in every Rails app says all the URLs (routes) that a user can visit and when someone visits the URL we say which class and which method Rails should execute to handle the request. Here is an example of a route: # config/routes.rb self.get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) The method here is get27 and there are parentheses for its two arguments: - The first argument to get is a String: the path that we want users to be able to visit (the path is the portion of the URL that comes after the domain name). Here it is \"/rock\" - The second argument to get is a Hash: this is where we tell Rails which method to call when a user visits the path in the first argument. (We’ll have to actually write this method in the next step, after we write the route.) The `Hash` must have two key/value pairs: - `:controller`: The value for this key is what we&#39;re going to name the _class_ that contains the method we want Rails to call when the user visits the path. For now we&#39;re going to default this value to `&quot;application&quot;` — you&#39;ll see why in a minute. - `:action`: The value for this key is the what we&#39;re going to name the method itself. &quot;Action&quot; is the term used to refer to Ruby methods that are triggered by users visiting URLs. - The `Hash` is saying: &quot;Use a `Class` (controller) called `application_controller`, and in that `Class` use a `method` (action) called `play_rock` to generate a response for the user.&quot; Don’t be confused by the key names :controller and :action, these are equivalent to a Ruby Class and method. They just have special names in the lingo of web applications. The get method is inherited, we don’t need to build this method ourselves, which saves us a lot of time. We get the plumbing for free and we just need to tell Rails how we want each request to be handled by declaring our routes. 14.2.1 Text Companion: Route Later we’ll use other methods, post(), etc, if we want to support requests using the other HTTP verbs.↩︎ "],["video-segment-controller-action-view.html", "14.3 Video Segment: Controller, Action, View", " 14.3 Video Segment: Controller, Action, View Notes: time stamp 00:07:10 to 00:08:30 all about app/controllers/ ApplicationController inheritance All of our controller classes will be in the app/controllers/ folder. There’s already one controller that comes with every Rails app out-of-the-box: ApplicationController, found in app/controllers/application_controller.rb. This is the controller that the above route is referring to. We will just use this controller for now. Later we will make separate controllers to keep our code organized. An example of an action looks like this: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock self.redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) end end We get the first line class definition for “free”: class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base It comes with Rails. It inherits &lt; from the Base class which is inside the Rails gem, so we would need to go into the Rails gem on GitHub to actually look at it. BENP: gem has maybe not be defined or discussed yet. possible footnote here. Also this is our first time talking about inheritence, so may need some expansion Then we define a method: def play_rock And inside of that we could write whatever steps we want (like calls to GoogleMaps or weather services from DarkSky BENP: I don’t think either of these have been presented at this point in the class). At the end of the day, the job of an action is to send back a response to the user. A response can be either: Rendering some data, in any one of many formats: Plain text. JSON for an application to consume — we’ve seen JSON before (in APIs), and consumed it ourselves with our Ruby scripts. HTML for their browser to draw — we’ll learn this soon. Less commonly, any other format: CSV, PDF, XML, etc. Or, the action can forward the user to another URL. This is known as redirecting. We get a method for each of these two: render for the first, and redirect_to for the second. In this case, we redirect to another URL: self.redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) As you can see, the argument to redirect_to is a String which contains some URL that you want the user to simply be forwarded to. This will come in handy later when, for example, we want to send the user directly back to a list of all photos after they’ve deleted a photo. 14.3.1 Text Companion: Controller, Action, View "],["video-segment-dropping-self..html", "14.4 Video Segment: Dropping self.", " 14.4 Video Segment: Dropping self. Notes: time stamp 00:08:30 to 00:11:00 why we drop self. Just to get something out of the way: Usually we always call object.method, and we are using the self keyword above because we are calling these methods on the instance of the class (ApplicationController) that we are defining the method (play_rock) for. Kind of like when we learned about the Person class and there is first_name and last_name, and if we wanted a full_name method we called self.first_name + self.last_name. In this case we’re defining play_rock and we want use the method redirect which already exists on ApplicationController, since it’s inherited via &lt; ActionController::Base. The point is, we are using a method that already exists to build our new method, hence self.redirect_to. In Ruby, when you’re calling a method on self, you can drop the self., and Ruby will figure it out, so we can rewrite the route, controller, action steps to: # config/routes.rb get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) {: mark_lines=“3” } and # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) end end {: mark_lines=“5” } 14.4.1 Text Companion: Dropping .self "],["video-segment-starting-our-gitpod-workspace.html", "14.5 Video Segment: Starting Our GitPod Workspace", " 14.5 Video Segment: Starting Our GitPod Workspace Notes: time stamp 00:11:00 to 00:13:30 these are common steps that should be done first in any project maybe link to Technical Setup Let’s spin up a workspace and open the RPS-RCAV GitPod so we can visualize the steps and see some results. We’ll finally make our Rock Paper Scissors game work, by having the computer opponent randomly choose a move rather than always playing paper.

The target for this project here, looks similar to what we have produced, but the key is that the computer plays different moves, and the application is finally dynamic. So how do we get here? 14.5.1 Text Companion: Starting Our GitPod Workspace "],["video-segment-our-first-rcav.html", "14.6 Video Segment: Our First RCAV", " 14.6 Video Segment: Our First RCAV Notes: time stamp 00:13:30 to 00:18:40 debugging an RCAV for /rock RTEM ends with redirect_to Our workflow for a dynamic web application is always the same: Route, Controller, Action, View (RCAV). Remember, the world is ruled by URLs. So we will always start with what URL we want to build and get it to work. If we begin by navigating to the route /rock in our Rails browser: http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, then we get an error message: No route matches [GET] “/rock”. We need to Read The Error Message (RTEM) and define the first route that will allow us to support a request of the form for our users. Let’s open the file config/routes.rb and define the route by adding the following code: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“5” } (All of our routes must be contained within the block following Rails.application.routes.draw. A new Rails app will already come with this code pre-written in routes.rb.) Again, we have our route \"/rock\" and our key/value pairs for the :controller (or Class) and :action (or method). We need to choose values for the :controller that Rails will use and the :action within the controller that will be called. For now we are just using the app/controllers/application_controller.rb for the controller, and we will define our action play_rock in there. We now need to open app/controllers/application_controller.rb to add some code. Note that Rails is smart and will add _controller.rb to our :controller argument in get, and within that controller file you will see the class has the underscores removed and is capitalized as ApplicationController. These are helpful conventions, and are best followed. BENP: is that last thing a fair statment? In this file we will add the following: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock end end {: mark_lines=“9-10”} We need our action to exactly match what we wrote in the config/routes.rb file, here play_rock. Between the def play_rock and end that we added, we could put whatever and however much code we would like to execute in that action for the user. In the end we will need to either render some HTML back to the user or redirect the user to another place. Let’s begin by just redirecting to some other URL: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock # write your code here redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) end end {: mark_lines=“10-12”} And we just created a full RCAV request lifecycle. If we go back to the browser and refresh the URL: http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, then we will end up on Wikipedia. If I go back to GitPod and look in my server log (use Cmd + J to open and close the log, Cmd + K to clear the log), then I will see something like: We can see exactly what happened. Someone tried to GET \"/rock\" from a given IP address at a given time, we found a route with instructions to use ApplicationController#play_rock (where the Something#something is Ruby shorthand for Class.method, with the . exchanged for a #), calling this controller-action pair resulted in a redirect to the given URL (https://www.wikipedia.org), and the entire request lifecycle completed in the stated time with no errors. 14.6.1 Text Companion: Our First RCAV "],["video-segment-render-html.html", "14.7 Video Segment: Render HTML", " 14.7 Video Segment: Render HTML Notes: time stamp 00:18:40 to 00:26:38 from render({ :plain =&gt; \"Hello, world!\" }) to render({ :template =&gt; \"game_templates/user_rock.html.erb\" }) .html vs. .html.erb app/views/ view templates rather than public/ We’ve written our first functional action, which just forwards someone to a new page. Now let’s try to render some of our own HTML, rather than redirecting to Wikipedia. We can change the previous code in app/controllers/application_controller.rb to: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) render({ :plain =&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“12-14”} Rather than using redirect_to(), which we inherited &lt; from the Rails Base class, we’ll use another inherited method to complete the request lifecycle: render(). This method, takes a Hash as an argument with a key/value pair. The key has many options, here we will use :plain, which will just send back plain text. A boring response, but good to start with. Now if I pretend I’m a user and visit http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, then I get a page with my \"Hello, world!\" rendered. Congratulations! You’ve wired up a route; prepare to do it a million more times, because all developers do all day is pick the next spec , wire up the route for the URL so that a user can visit it, and then implement the logic to send back the correct information. Remember, we did not create and send a file, we are using Ruby to generate this reponse, opening a world of possibilities. For instance, what if we instead rendered a random number: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) render({ :plain =&gt; rand(100) }) end end {: mark_lines=“14”} Now everytime we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, we get a different random number, generated automatically by Ruby. This is a dynamic response, not just a static page that we placed in the public folder. This is a simple example, but fundamentally that’s it. We connected a URL to a method that can do anything. It can call APIs, parse CSVs, compute whatever you want, run machine learning models. With this we can do anything. Of course, there is a lot more to learn, but fundamentally this is it. Now let’s send back some actual HTML: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) end end {: mark_lines=“14”} The :html key to render() allows us to place whatever HTML we want in a string that will be shown on the page. We need the .html_safe on the end of the string, which is a bit of Rails security to make sure that one user can’t inject malicious HTML into another user’s browser, in case we were getting the given HTML string from another user (e.g., from a &lt;form&gt;). Don’t worry about this, we will see a better way of doing this in a moment. If we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, then we will see our HTML. We could go crazy and put our entire HTML document in that string. But a much, much better way to to write what’s called an embedded Ruby template. # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) # render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“16”} The :template key to render() allows us to assign a template to render. We specify the name of a folder game_templates/ and file user_rock.html.erb that will contain all of our HTML. This is an .erb for embedded Ruby template file, rather than a plain old .html file. We create this file in the existing app/views/ folder, which is a way better place than public/, because users do not have access to all of its contents. We will keep things organized and put different templates in different sub-folders. Do not put the .html.erb file in the app/views/layouts/ folder that already exists, first make a new folder in app/views/ called game_templates/ then make the new file in this folder called user_rock.html.erb. BENP: insert image(s) (gifs? would be better here; cf. video 00:25:20) of new folder and new file steps in GitPod You can call the game_templates/user_rock.html.erb folder and file whatever you want. The user will not see the folder or the file, they will only see \"/rock\", the specified route. Now you can enter in your new user_rock.html.erb file some HTML to render: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; Don’t forget to save the file changes if you haven’t done so. And now when we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, we get the text from our file rendered in HTML. So after all of that we have an HTML page that basically does what we could have done quickly if we made a file called rock.html in the public/ folder. 14.7.1 Text Companion: Render HTML "],["video-segment-embedded-ruby-tags.html", "14.8 Video Segment: Embedded Ruby Tags", " 14.8 Video Segment: Embedded Ruby Tags Notes: time stamp 00:26:38 to 00:31:37 all about &lt;% %&gt; and &lt;%= %&gt; in a view template But we can do something way better with this new system. Let’s add the following to our embedded Ruby file: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“5-7”} Now we created a new tag that looks like HTML, but contains a doorway to Ruby: &lt;%= %&gt;. We can write any Ruby we want in that embedded Ruby tag, and this is what makes the whole effort of RCAV worthwhile. For instance we can write: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= 6 * 7 %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“6”} And we will see the result of this computation when we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock. But if we go to view source in the browser, we won’t see the Ruby code. We only see the result 42. The browser only understands HTML and has no idea of the code that allows us to make the web application dynamic. So rails is processing all of the embedded Ruby tags and injecting them in the document before it sends the plain HTML file to the browser. We could also do something like &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample %&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= 6 * 7 %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“5”} Here, we used a slightly different embedded Ruby tag: &lt;% %&gt;. We left off the = sign, which means the output of this Ruby code will be hidden in the final HTML. But, the variable comp_move (which is the result of randomly sampling an array of three possble string values) is still available and we can render it by changing the file again: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample %&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“8”} Such that our calculated variable comp_move is now rendered in the final HTML output, because it is in a &lt;%= %&gt; tag, with the = sign. And we will see the result of this computation when we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock. View the source code here and you won’t see any sign of the comp_move variable computation from the &lt;% %&gt; tag. BENP: Now could be time for a screenshot or better GIF of refreshing /rock a couple of times to see the output and showing the source code. Alright, we are now finally building dynamic web applications. We are able to render a template, we are able to write some HTML, and we able use embedded Ruby tags: &lt;% %&gt; for hidden content, and &lt;%= %&gt; for rendered content that the user will see. 14.8.1 Text Companion: Embedded Ruby Tags "],["video-segment-control-flow-with-embedded-ruby.html", "14.9 Video Segment: Control Flow with Embedded Ruby", " 14.9 Video Segment: Control Flow with Embedded Ruby Notes: time stamp 00:31:37 to 00:37:10 conditionals all about &lt;% if ... %&gt; Now we can actually compute who won or lost our Rock Paper Scissors match. Let’s add this long if-else Ruby code to our game_templates/ file: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample %&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% if comp_move == &quot;rock&quot; %&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We tied!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% elsif comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; %&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We lost!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% elsif comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; %&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We won!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; {: mark_lines=“11-17”} Above, we used hidden &lt;% %&gt; embedded Ruby tags in our control flow on each line we wanted to hide, so none of this will be rendered to the user. Only the result of this control flow &lt;h2&gt;We tied!&lt;/h2&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;We lost!&lt;/h2&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;We won!&lt;/h2&gt; will be rendered, depending on the randomly sampled comp_move variable. Refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock to see. And now would be a good time to run rails grade at the GitPod console to check our progress. And remember to Always Be Committing, by making a /git commit. We have a lot done, but we still have a lot to do. 14.9.1 Text Companion: Control Flow with Embedded Ruby "],["video-segment-homepage.html", "14.10 Video Segment: Homepage", " 14.10 Video Segment: Homepage Notes: time stamp 00:37:10 to 00:40:18 RCAV with render for / The target has a homepage at the root URL, /. In the old days, we would create a file in public/ called index.html, but now we are pretty much done with public/ except maybe for static assets like images or css files, but we won’t put any more user-facing URL pages there. Those will be connected up with routes from here on. Let’s go to our config/routes.rb and add a homepage route: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;homepage&quot; }) get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“5” } We are adding the \"/\" homepage route, we are using the application_controller.rb file, and we are using the action (or the method within the ApplicationController) that we call homepage. Now if I refresh the http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/ page, I get an error message that the homepage action cannot be found in ApplicationController: The action &#39;play_rock&#39; could not be found for ApplicationController This is good! That means we defined the route correctly. If you still see a “No route matches” error, then double-check your route syntax and get that error to go away before you proceed further. The error occurs because we did not yet define the action. So we need to go to our app/controllers/application_controller.rb file and add: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def homepage render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/rules.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) # render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“9-11”} And now we can create that new file game_templates/rules.html.erb, and add to it: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/rules.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to RPS&lt;/h1&gt; Now when we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/, there is no error and our HTML template is rendered. And we did not put any HTML in the public folder! You will almost always want some kind of dynamic behavior on every page. So our new workflow is always RCAV: Define a route, assign a controller, create an action in that controller, and view the result. 14.10.1 Text Companion: Homepage "],["video-segment-reinforce-rcav-with-paper.html", "14.11 Video Segment: Reinforce RCAV with /paper", " 14.11 Video Segment: Reinforce RCAV with /paper Notes: time stamp 00:40:18 to 00:44:27 RCAV with render for /paper Let’s start with the /paper route, for when we play paper. First we define the route in config/routes.rb with a controller: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;homepage&quot; }) get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) get(&quot;/paper&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_paper&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“9” } Again, we use the application_controller.rb. If we pretend we are a user now and go to http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/paper, we again get the “action not found” error. The helpful error message (RTEM!) tells us we need to define another method for the action in our controller called play_paper. We are in our Route, Controller, Action, View sequence that makes Rails so useful! It’s the same flow, over and over again. All we need to do is keep visiting the route and RTEM to find the next step. Ok, let’s define the action in our app/controllers/application_controller.rb: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def homepage render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/rules.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) # render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_paper render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_paper.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“23-26”} Now we can pretend we are a user and again refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/paper. And we’ll get a new error message that tells us we are missing the view template: If you cannot figure out what your typo is and why an error message keeps coming up, then delete what you wrote and try to type it again from scratch (or talk to your rubber duck). We RTEM above and that tells us to go and make the new game_templates/user_paper.html.erb file that will be rendered to the user: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_paper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We played paper! &lt;/h2&gt; And now our view at http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/paper renders content with no error message. A successful RCAV! 14.11.1 Text Companion: Reinforce RCAV with /paper "],["video-segment-embedded-ruby-in-the-controller-with-instance-variables.html", "14.12 Video Segment: Embedded Ruby in the Controller with Instance Variables", " 14.12 Video Segment: Embedded Ruby in the Controller with Instance Variables Notes: time stamp 00:44:27 to 00:54:20 moving conditional control flow &lt;% if ... %&gt; from /rock into the ApplicationController action play_rock local variables vs. instance variables with @-notation Now that we are RCAV pros, let me show you another (perhaps better, depending on your taste) way of writing our embedded Ruby code. Let’s return to the game_templates/user_rock.html.erb file: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample %&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% if comp_move == &quot;rock&quot; %&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We tied!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% elsif comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; %&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We lost!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% elsif comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; %&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We won!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; {: mark_lines=“5”} The highlighted code &lt;% comp_move = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"].sample %&gt; is okay, but you could imagine that in a real application there may be dozens of lines of code to prepare the information that we actually want to show the user. Our example is trivial. In reality we may lookup data from a database, doing math on it, finding API data, and more. Think of our “take your umbrella” example BENP: insert link to this DarkSky API example; but wait, has it even been presented up to this point?, which took around 30 lines of Ruby code to produce. We want somewhere other than the HTML template to put this code. We can in fact do that! Let’s go back to the game_templates/user_paper.html.erb file, since we didn’t get as far there and see how we can make this modification. We would like our file to look like this: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_paper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We played paper! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We &lt;%= outcome %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“7-13”} We wish we could just do this and avoid all the lines of embedded Ruby that are in the previous user_rock.html.erb view template. The responsibility for these computations really don’t belong here, the view templates should be given some data and then the job should just be to format and present it beautifuly and usably to the user. In the backend the responsibility should be marshalling the correct data and sending it to the view template. We can return to our app/controllers/application_controller.rb controller file and do the following: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def homepage render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/rules.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) # render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_paper comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample if comp_move == &quot;rock&quot; outcome = &quot;won&quot; elsif comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; outcome = &quot;tied&quot; elsif comp_move == &quot;scissors&quot; outcome = &quot;lost&quot; end render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_paper.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“23-31”} In the above highlighted code we have removed all of the embedded Ruby tags (&lt;% %&gt; and &lt;%= %&gt;) from the code we had in the .html.erb view template. Now when a user visits the route http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/paper, the action play_paper in the controller ApplicationController will be triggered, and the code will be run before the template is rendered. So let’s try to visit http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/paper again. Oops, we get this error: In our game_templates/user_paper.html.erb view template, when we get to the first embedded Ruby tag: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_paper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We played paper! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We &lt;%= outcome %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“8”} That local variable comp_move is undefined! A local variable only exists in the scope it was defined. If I create a local variable in a loop, it will only exist in that loop. If I want some variable available outside the loop, then I would need to create it outside the loop and modify it in the loop. So there’s a scope to local variables and I can’t just use it in my template if I created it in the play_paper method (action). The variable is effectively “dead” after play_paper executes. So how do we make the controller variables available in the view template? Let’s modify our app/controllers/application_controller.rb: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def homepage render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/rules.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) # render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_paper @comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample if @comp_move == &quot;rock&quot; @outcome = &quot;won&quot; elsif @comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; @outcome = &quot;tied&quot; elsif @comp_move == &quot;scissors&quot; @outcome = &quot;lost&quot; end render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_paper.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“23 25-30”} All we did was place an @ symbol before any variable that we want access to in our view template. This is a new kind of variable called an instance variable. This type of variable will survive as long as the instance the object in which its created survives BENP: last sentence a bit confusing. In this case when someone visits /paper, Rails is going to create an instance of the ApplicationController class and then run the play_paper method. So as long as the ApplicationController instance is alive (Rails keeps it until the response is sent to the user), the variables produced by play_paper will exist. When someone visits /paper, we now have @comp_move and @outcome available for our template. We just need to make sure those instance variables are also properly referenced in game_templates/user_paper.html.erb: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_paper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We played paper! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= @comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We &lt;%= @outcome %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“8 12”} Again, we just use the leading @ symbols on our variables to tie them to the instance variables in the controller. And if we visit the /paper URL, it works! And we have a much improved organization. Most computation work like this should go in the controller as we have done it here. We will have cases where embedded Ruby goes in the template (e.g., rendering database records with each loops, if statements to check if a user is allowed to see something, other conditional statements). If it can happen in the controller, it should happen there.

But if we click on “Play Rock” here, and we are taken to the /rock URL, then the links are not there, because we only put them in the game_templates/user_paper.html.erb file, and not in the game_templates/user_rock.html.erb file, which is what visiting the /rock URL will render. BENP: In the below example, we use the app/views/layouts/wrapper.html.erb file that we create, but in all other class work we use app/views/layouts/application.html.erb to place our headers and footers. Maybe we change the below section to just do it with that, which also I think allows us to omit the layout(\"wrapper.html.erb)\" call? How can we avoid repeating these HTML navigation links in all of our view templates? Well, here is one of the great benefits of working in Rails instead of HTML. We are dynamically generating responses rather than hard-coding into a bunch of files. If there is common stuff we want on every page, like a nav-bar or footer, then we can make a special file in app/views/layouts/ and call it whatever we like. Let’s create a file in that folder called wrapper.html.erb and let’s fill our new app/views/layouts/wrapper.html.erb file with: &lt;!-- app/view/layouts/wrapper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/rock&quot;&gt;Play Rock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/paper&quot;&gt;Play Paper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/scissors&quot;&gt;Play Scissors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Copyright, Appdev 2022. All rights reserved. {: mark_lines=“13”} Now every page that we visit will have all of its contents placed where the above highlighted code says &lt;%= yield %&gt;. We just need to also change our application_controller.rb file to note this and have it take effect: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(&quot;wrapper.html.erb&quot;) {: mark_lines=“4”} This layout method takes one argument and it already knows to look in the folder app/views/layouts/ for the file that we created. After this change, try visiting your pages using the links on every page. It should work (except for /scissors because we haven’t done the RCAV for that page yet). If we only wanted the layout to apply on a per-page basis we could also leave layout(false) in the previous code, and we could in the play_rock method (action) change our render statement to: render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot;, :layout =&gt; &quot;wrapper.html.erb&quot; }) This additional :layout argument would then only put the nav-bar and footer in wrapper.html.erb on the /rock route.

Rather than rendering a pre-defined message in plain text, it’s usually more helpful to the iPhone developer to render the data in JSON format, so that they can parse it, easily fetch whichever values they need, and assemble their own interface. Here is some JSON that would be convenient for an external application to parse: { &quot;player_move&quot;:&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;comp_move&quot;:&quot;paper&quot;, &quot;outcome&quot;:&quot;lost&quot; } Notice that JSON uses strings as keys — this is because JavaScript doesn’t have the equivalent of Ruby’s Symbol class. Also, there are no hash rockets; JSON just uses colons to separate keys and values. Fortunately, just as it was easy for us to convert a String containing JSON into Ruby Arrays/Hashes using the JSON.parse method, it is also easy for us to go in the other direction: both Array and Hash have methods called .to_json. Let’s create a Ruby Hash that resembles the JSON above: response_hash = { :player_move =&gt; &quot;rock&quot;, :comp_move =&gt; &quot;paper&quot;, :outcome =&gt; &quot;lost&quot; } We can then convert this into a String in JSON format with .to_json: response_hash.to_json returns: &quot;{\\&quot;player_move\\&quot;:\\&quot;rock\\&quot;,\\&quot;comp_move\\&quot;:\\&quot;paper\\&quot;,\\&quot;outcome\\&quot;:\\&quot;lost\\&quot;}&quot; The \\\" represents double-quotes; we need the backslash, known as an “escape”, because we’re already within a double-quoted string and don’t want to terminate it. You can puts the string to see it formatted: puts response_hash.to_json displays: {&quot;player_move&quot;:&quot;rock&quot;,&quot;comp_move&quot;:&quot;paper&quot;,&quot;outcome&quot;:&quot;lost&quot;} Great! That means we can update our action if we want to send back JSON instead: class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock moves = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;] comp_move = moves.sample if comp_move == &quot;rock&quot; outcome = &quot;tied&quot; elsif comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; outcome = &quot;lost&quot; elsif comp_move == &quot;scissors&quot; outcome = &quot;won&quot; end response_hash = { :player_move =&gt; &quot;rock&quot;, :comp_move =&gt; &quot;paper&quot;, :outcome =&gt; &quot;lost&quot; } render({ :plain =&gt; response_hash.to_json }) end end Congratulations — you just built your first API endpoint!  14.15.2 Addendum: Custom Controller Files We don’t have to put all of our actions within the default ApplicationController file that comes included with any Rails app; we can add our own controllers, if we want to organize things a bit more. With an app of any non-trivial size, you’ll end up with hundreds of actions, and it can get unwieldy to put them all in one gigantic application_controller.rb. Instead, we can change our route for /rock to this: get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;game&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) Now when a user visits /rock, they will see an error uninitialized constant GameController. As we know, when Ruby says “uninitialized constant” it means “I can’t find that class”. So, what’s going on here? When we said :controller =&gt; \"game\" in the route, we told Rails to look for a class called GameController when someone visits /rock. All of the controller class names will end in ...Controller, and they will begin with whatever value we provided for the key :controller in the route. Like all Ruby classes, the name must be CamelCase (not snake_case or Some_Hybrid). So in this case, it will be GameController. The class must be defined in a Ruby file that is the snake_cased version of its name. Rails will itself use the .underscore method to figure out the name; we can try it ourselves in rails console: [2] pry(main)&gt; &quot;GameController&quot;.underscore =&gt; &quot;game_controller&quot; The Ruby file must be placed within the app/controllers/ folder. So, in this case, we create a file called app/controllers/game_controller.rb (don’t forget the .rb file extension). Finally, within this file, we define the class: class GameController &lt; ApplicationController end We inherit from ApplicationController, which in turn inherits from ActionController::Base; much like our models inherited from ActiveRecord::Base via ApplicationRecord. Our models inherited .save, .where, and a bunch of other awesome database-related methods from ActiveRecord::Base; whereas our controllers are going to inherit a bunch of methods like render, redirect_to, and a bunch of other awesome interface-related methods from ActionController::Base. Don’t forget the end that goes with the class; type it before you forget it. Move your play_rock action over from application_controller.rb into this new class. Now, when a user visits the path /rock, the “uninitialized constant” error should go away and you should see a response as before. If you still see the “unitialized constant” error, then: You named your class wrong; it must exactly match the value in routes.rb, followed by Controller (singular), and CamelCase. You named the file wrong. Try doing .underscore on a string containing the class name in rails console to figure out the correct filename. You put the file in the wrong folder. It has to be within app/controllers/. Not within, for example, app/ or app/controllers/concerns/. You forgot the .rb file extension. If you can’t find which of the above it is, try deleting what you did and paving over your work again from scratch. Sometimes you just can’t spot your own typos, and paving over is the best approach. You can make as many controllers as you like; in general, a rule of thumb is to have one controller per database table.

The second URL /square_root/new let’s me enter a number, again “42”, and then I end up at the URL /square_root/results?user_number=42. There’s a query string starting at the ? there: ?user_number=42. There is also the URL path /payment/new with three inputs, and finally there is /random/new with two inputs. So let’s make these four links (URL paths) work. In doing so, we’ll see the fundamental pieces in making all forms work, and that is fundamentally how we get all of our user input. 15.1.1 Text Companion: Intro to Forms and Exploring the Target "],["video-segment-squarenew-rcav.html", "15.2 Video Segment: /square/new RCAV", " 15.2 Video Segment: /square/new RCAV Notes: time stamp 00:02:26 to 00:11:25 RCAV with RTEM for /square/new debugging Okay, so here is how this is gonna go. First and foremost, as always, it’s going to be a question of RCAV: Route, Controller, Action, View. That comes first, before anything. We need to identify the URLs users can visit, make up a route, and then first of all just make the page say something (anything) just to make sure we connected the RCAV dots correctly. Then we can figure out what do we actually need to show them, what, if any, Ruby do we need to write to make the page dynamic and all that other stuff. So let us first begin with let’s say the form at /square/new. We need to define this URL and then make it display a form to match the target. Pretty simple, there is nothing dynamic going on here, it’s just a static HTML page. Actually we could probably achieve this in the /public folder, but from now on we won’t do anything in there, we will always do RCAV, just to give us the flexibility of later embedding Ruby if we want to. My workflow is: pretend I’m a user, navigate to a URL I want to start supporting, and start debugging it one step at a time. Let’s begin by navigating (typing into the address bar) in our new Rails app http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/square/new. And in my staring point I will see: Routing Error No route matches [GET] &quot;/square/new&quot; BENP: in RPS-RCAV I added screenshots for error messages, probably fine to just do as here with code blocks So step one is opening config/routes.rb in our GitPod workspace, and add some code to it: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/square/new&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;blank_square_form&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“5” } BENP: in the video at 00:05:14, the routes.rb file has some additional content not on the GitHub starting point. devise_for blah blah blah. We can maybe leave this code out from above? The first argument is the String defining the path that the user can visit, and the second argument defines the class (:controller) and method (:action) that are activated when someone visits the path. We decided on a method name called \"blank_square_form\", since the job of it is just to show a form for the user to type into when the user wants to calculate the square of a number. We decided we will put this method in the controller that comes with Rails out of the box: \"application\", which is found in the app/controllers/application_controller.rb file and has the class name ApplicationController when we open that file: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base end In our config/routes.rb, we tell Rails to look in this controller for our method whenever someone visits the route /square/new. Later when we have larger applications, and we begin having more actions, we’ll break it into multiple controllers. Now if pretend to be users in our running application and try to visit that route we get a new error: The action &#39;blank_square_form&#39; could not be found for ApplicationController The routing error is gone, which tells me I put the route in the right place, and didn’t have any typos. The new error message is saying that it found the route and controller, but the method (action) is missing. We still need to add our method to the app/controllers/application_controller.rb controller file: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def blank_square_form render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“4-7” } I made up a name for a folder to but the templates in to keep things organized and I named the file. So we now need to go into our app/views/ folder, create a new folder called calculation_templates (do not create this folder or file in the layouts/ subfolder!) and then create a new file in that folder called square_form.html.erb. We can right away add something to that file, just to make sure that it works: &lt;!-- app/views/calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;howdy!&lt;/h1&gt; Now we can go back to our Rails app browser tab and refresh the /square/new URL. When we refresh, we see “howdy” and know that our RCAV is complete. Note that I don’t try to type everything at once, work in very small steps and give yourself feedback (view) as early as you possibly can to make sure the code that you typed is doing what you think it is. If you see an error message up to this point then go back and be sure to RTEM! Let the error message help you. If it says “No route matches”, you might have typed in the URL in the address bar wrong (try to visit /squarre/new and see that happen), or you might have a typo in your config/routes.rb file in the get() call. Use the error messages and debug. It is very deterministic and will do exactly what you tell it to do. Rails is looking at this in a clear order. You visit a route, then it looks for the controller in the app/controllers/ folder and if that file is found, then it looks inside the file and looks for a class with the same name as the file (but capitalized and with underscores removed), then it looks for the action (method) in that class called whatever we defined it as in get(), then it will run that method. At every step, if something isn’t found, you will get a clear error message pointing out where the problem occurred and it is up to you to go back and correct. If you can’t spot the problem often the easiest thing to do is comment out your code and start from scratch typing everything. It’s quicker sometimes to pave over the typo, when they are hard to spot. 15.2.1 Text Companion: /square/new RCAV "],["video-segment-squarenew-form.html", "15.3 Video Segment: /square/new Form", " 15.3 Video Segment: /square/new Form Notes: time stamp 00:11:25 to 00:14:12 building a form in the /square/new view template &lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;, &lt;label&gt;&lt;/label&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt; valid forms with for=\"\" and id=\"\" Now that we have the /square/new form saying something, we need to think about what it should actually do. It needs to have a form with a label and one text input and a button. Alright, if we refresh our memories and go back to the slides from the essential HTML review, there is a slide about forms, which we looked at in class. BENP: link here? Probably not necessary. I could not find this slide. Better to just link form chapter content. We can go into our view template for the current form and do the following: &lt;!-- app/views/calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;howdy!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form&gt; &lt;label&gt;&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input&gt; &lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“5-10”} We have an opening and closing tag (&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;) to bracket the form, then a label tag (&lt;label&gt;&lt;/label&gt;), then an input tag (&lt;input&gt;, no closing necessary), then a button tag (&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;). These are the essential form elements. Now what about the copy? Let’s have a look at our target URL so we can get the copy right, because rails grade will be looking for it – you have to build to the spec that you’ve been “hired” to build. You can just make up your own copy willy nilly. Once we have the copy, we go back to our view template and add some more: &lt;!-- app/views/calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;howdy!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form&gt; &lt;label&gt;Enter a number&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input&gt; &lt;button&gt;Calculate square&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“6 9”} Now that we have the copy, we need to make this form proper by adding the following: &lt;!-- app/views/calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;howdy!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;giraffe&quot;&gt;Enter a number&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;giraffe&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;What number do you want to square?&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Calculate square&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“6-7”} We always need to associate inputs and labels with an id and a for. Every form control must always have an id and be labelled with a unique string. It doesn’t matter what the value is, it just needs to match for accessibility and for machines to understand the form. We just picked something random. It doesn’t matter so we just used \"giraffe\" for both. BENP: this use of random id and for is a little confusing because it’s not how we would do it later in the course or in reality. I’m in favor of using realistic form associations from this point already In addition, we added the type as \"text\" for the input, which is the default and would be used anyway even if we left it out. We also added a placeholder to add the gray text from our target: \"What number do you want to square?\". We can return to our Rails app and refresh /square/new to see our form. Great! 15.3.1 Text Companion: /square/new Form "],["video-segment-query-string-and-parameters-hash.html", "15.4 Video Segment: Query String and Parameters Hash", " 15.4 Video Segment: Query String and Parameters Hash Notes: time stamp 00:14:12 to 00:16:36 everything after ? from /square/new form and the Parameters Hash If I type in “42” and hit calculate, my form is terrible, it doesn’t really do anything. At least when I click the label “Enter a number” it puts the focus on the input box, so my association is wired up correctly. But when I click the button it doesn’t take me anywhere. Forms are like links, when you click on them they are supposed to take you to another URL, not keep you on the same page. The form is also supposed to put whatever I typed into the address bar after the ? symbol. One of the key problems I have is not naming my input, so let’s do that in our form: &lt;!-- app/views/calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;howdy!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;giraffe&quot;&gt;Enter a number&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;giraffe&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;What number do you want to square?&quot; name=&quot;elephant&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Calculate square&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“7”} Just to be silly BENP: again, maybe use realistic for, id, name from this point already we named the input \"elephant\". And now when I refresh (the back arrow won’t change anything) the form at /square/new, and enter in 42 again then hit the calculate button, I will see a new URL string: /square/new?elephant=42. Now even though the form isn’t taking me to another place, at least the value I typed is getting preserved in the query string in the URL. And because of the way that Rails work, that value, if it’s in a query string, Rails is going to parse it and put it in a very special Hash. We can view that Hash in our GitPod terminal (Cmd + J to open or close it): This Hash with the name Parameters is now available in our entire app: in the view template, the action, we can use it anywhere. That is the crux of how we get information out of forms. All we need to do is name an input in the form, and that will capture the variable in our query string and Rails will put it in a hash that we can access. After all the API work that we’ve done BENP: wait, did we do API work up to this point? we are pros at capturing things out of hashes. Time for a /git commit (perhaps with the title message “Square form looking pretty good, doesn’t work yet” or something along those lines), and maybe even a rails grade to see what’s left to do. 15.4.1 Text Companion: Query String and Parameters Hash "],["video-segment-squareresults-rcav.html", "15.5 Video Segment: /square/results RCAV", " 15.5 Video Segment: /square/results RCAV Notes: time stamp 00:16:36 to 00:23:48 building the /square/results RCAV and form more on query strings If we look at how the target works, when we enter a number (why not…“42”?) to square and click calculate, then we end up at another URL /square/results?number=42. I started at /square/new and when I click, it takes me to /square/results, a page with different markup and different content from the starting point. Let’s send the user there in our app. We will need to start by going through our RCAV steps. Remember to work in small steps and refresh the view often. Keep Reading the Error Message and slowly debugging. Get used to this process, we will be doing it over and over again! Route, Controller, Action, View! First, the route. Go to your app’s browser and manually navigate to /square/new. RTEM. Time to add a route: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/square/new&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;blank_square_form&quot; }) get(&quot;/square/results&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;calculate_square&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“7” } Since this is when the user is actually calculating (as opposed to requesting a blank form with \"blank_square_form\"), we call the action \"calculate_square\". Now refresh the browser again and RTEM. The route should be set, and it’s time to add an action (method) in our controller (class): # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def blank_square_form render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb&quot; }) end def calculate_square render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_results.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“9-12” } We keep using the same calculation_templates/ folder. Now if we refresh again and RTEM, we see the action was found, but now we need to make a new file in app/views/calculation_templates/ called square_results.html.erb. Once we create that file and enter some quick copy to view (why not…&lt;h1&gt;hi&lt;/h1&gt;?), we refresh once more to see our completed, error-free RCAV cylce (assuming you don’t have any typos). Now let’s get the result page doing what we actually want. We begin by adding some formatting and HTML to our view template in app/views/calculation_templates/square_results.html.erb: &lt;!-- app/views/calculation_templates/square_results.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Square Results&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Number&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;something&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Square&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;something squared&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; {: mark_lines=“3-11”} We use a description list (&lt;dl&gt;) containing description terms (&lt;dt&gt;) and data (&lt;dd&gt;), as per the copy (remember to right click and “View Source”) in the target. Refresh out app, and everything should look okay on this page. But we just put in some placeholders for the result. Let’s actually make it dynamic. We need to put the original number in the first something and calculate the square to put the result in something squared. If I add a query string on the end of any URL in Rails (e.g., I can go to my app and add /square/results?user_number=42), and then I hit return, it doesn’t change anything. For the purposes of routing anything after the ? in a query string is ignored, but in the server log (GitPod terminal where we ran bin/server), we saw previously that everything after the ? is added as key/value pairs in the Parameters Hash: Parameters: {&quot;user_number&quot; =&gt; &quot;42&quot;} We could add a bunch of variables to our query string with &amp; and all of them would be separated in the Parameters. If we typed into our address bar /square/results?user_number=42&amp;zebra=12&amp;giraffe=82, hit enter, and return to our server log on GitPod, we would find: Parameters: {&quot;user_number&quot; =&gt; &quot;42&quot;, &quot;zebra&quot; =&gt; &quot;12&quot;, &quot;giraffe&quot; =&gt; &quot;82&quot;} So the query string is just a Hash! 15.5.1 Text Companion: /square/results RCAV "],["video-segment-form-action-and-params.html", "15.6 Video Segment: Form Action and params", " 15.6 Video Segment: Form Action and params Notes: time stamp 00:23:48 to 00:31:46 adding action=\"/square/results\" to the /square/new form using params Hash in the /square/results action to fetch from query string, calculate, and display Now if we go back to our form in our app at /square/new, enter “42”, and hit calculate, then it puts the query string together, but stays in the same place: /square/new?elephant=42. Remember we defined the name of the variable in our view template form as elephant. A bit silly, but we can roll with it. BENP: See what I mean? If we eliminate elephant above then we save on the awkward name here So this means we need to add a redirect action to our form, pull out the query string data, and do a calculation. So here’s the magic. Let’s open the view template at app/views/calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb: &lt;!-- app/views/calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;howdy!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/square/results&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;giraffe&quot;&gt;Enter a number&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;giraffe&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;What number do you want to square?&quot; name=&quot;elephant&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Calculate square&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“5”} The action attribute to the &lt;form&gt; is equivalent to the href in a link like &lt;a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org\"&gt;Go to wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. Putting \"https://www.wikipedia.org\" after action= would cause the form to redirect to WikiPedia after we click the button, you can try it yourself. Be sure to refresh the page, back buttons will not reload the code and the action will not work. Instead of redirecting away from our app though, we want our button click to send the user to /square/results, and that is what we specified above, and where the form will now go. Refresh /square/new, enter a number, click the button, and see for yourself. Again, if you tried the WikiPedia example, remember to refresh the page or your new action will not take effect. What happened? We entered “42”, we hit calculate, the form routed us to /square/results, Rails called the get() for this route, which used the controller and action to render our view template for this page, and on the end of our URL we have our input preserved: /square/results?elephant=42. And this input is also preserved in our Parameters Hash. Let’s pull out this data from the hash and use it in our action (contained in our controller) that was triggered when we were routed to the URL /square/results by our form: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def blank_square_form render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb&quot; }) end def calculate_square # params = {&quot;elephant&quot;=&gt;&quot;42&quot;} @num = params.fetch(&quot;elephant&quot;) @square_of_num = @num * @num render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_results.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“10-13” } From our server log, we copy-pasted in our hash and put this in a comment with the assigned variable params. This is for our own reference (it is in a comment #), but the variable params exists in every Rails app to store this hash. Hence we use it in the subsequent lines with our familiar Hash method .fetch() to pull out the key/value pair of interest. In this case we pull the user input (which we named elephant in our form) to an instance variable @num (because an instance variable will be accessible in our rendered view template \"calculation_templates/square_results.html.erb\"), and we calculate another instance variable @square_of_num to store our result for rendering. Let’s put these instance variables into that view template with embedded Ruby tags: &lt;!-- app/views/calculation_templates/square_results.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Square Results&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Number&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @num %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Square&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @square_of_num %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/square/new&quot;&gt;Calculate another square&lt;/a&gt; {: mark_lines=“7 10 13”} Note that we also added a link at the bottom (as per the target app) to return to the form and make another calculation. Now we can refresh the /square/new, enter data, and submit again… but wait! Another error message: undefined method `**&#39; for &quot;42&quot;:String Oops, the query string puts the data into the params Hash as a String object, but we need it as a float or integer to do math on it. Let’s return to our controller action and: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def blank_square_form render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb&quot; }) end def calculate_square # params = {&quot;elephant&quot;=&gt;&quot;42&quot;} @num = params.fetch(&quot;elephant&quot;).to_f @square_of_num = @num * @num render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_results.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“12” } We use a .to_f, since we want a float so the user can enter a decimal number (like “42.01”) and get the exact (not integer rounded) result. Now we can try once more, and everything should be up and running. Time for a /git commit (perhaps with the title message “Square form and calculation done” or something along those lines), and a rails grade to see what’s left to do. Do not use rails grade to debug, always test your app manually before running rails grade as the last check. 15.6.1 Text Companion: Form Action and params "],["video-segment-independence-of-routes.html", "15.7 Video Segment: Independence of Routes", " 15.7 Video Segment: Independence of Routes Notes: time stamp 00:31:46 to 00:43:13 use /random/results RCAV developed before /random/new to highlight independence of routes You will complete most of the rest of the assignment on your own, but let’s talk about one more thing using the /random/new URL path. We can have a look at the target and see that when we type in the “Minimum” using “1.5” and “Maximum” using “4.5” and click the button, we are routed to /random/results?user_min=1.5&amp;user_max=4.5. So this is the route we want to work. I want to point out here that in theory the /random/new page with the form and the /random/results page with the result are entirely independent. I could just build /random/results without /random/new, but then the user would need to manually type into the address bar their inputs after a query string: ?user_min=1.5&amp;user_max=4.5. Try and just change the URL to /random/results?user_min=0&amp;user_max=2. The page will change when you hit enter and we never used the form page. The point is, every RCAV is independent of every other RCAV. Clicking the button on our previous form for /square/new triggered a new and independent RCAV. We need to think of these things as independent, we are just cleverly arranging things such that there is a cause and effect, but this does not exist without our clever arrangement. So you can choose whatever names you want for inputs, parameters, or anything else. You just need to make sure whatever names you choose, that everything matches up so that at the end of the day you can retrieve the information you need. Don’t expect Rails to guess your intention, you need to instruct Rails what you want to do and it will follow your instructions to the letter. Let’s start the task of getting /random/new and /random/results to actually work. But let’s begin the other way around from before, by getting /random/results going first. So first step is to manually in my app enter the URL /random/results, get my familiar “No route matches” error and begin the RCAV cycle. First we add the route: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/square/new&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;blank_square_form&quot; }) get(&quot;/square/results&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;calculate_square&quot; }) get(&quot;/random/results&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;calculate_random&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“9” } Now we refresh our browser, RTEM, and add the action that we named in our controller: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def blank_square_form render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb&quot; }) end def calculate_square # params = {&quot;elephant&quot;=&gt;&quot;42&quot;} @num = params.fetch(&quot;elephant&quot;).to_f @square_of_num = @num * @num render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_results.html.erb&quot; }) end def calculate_random render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/random_results.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“18-21” } Now we refresh our browser, RTEM, and add the new view template that we named and put some copy in it: &lt;!-- app/views/calculation_templates/random_results.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;howdy&lt;/h1&gt; And if we refresh and get no error message, our RCAV is complete and now we just need to get the view template to actually render what we want. Try to manually navigate the URL to /random/results?user_min=1.5&amp;user_max=4.5. Now go to the GitPod server terminal (as usual Cmd + J to open or close it, and Cmd + K to clear the log for a better view) and you will see the query string transcribed in the Parameters Hash, which we know is accessible anywhere in our Rails app by params = { key =&gt; value}, or, in this case: params = { \"user_min\" =&gt; \"1.5\", \"user_max\" =&gt; \"4.5\" }. Okay so let’s get this out in our action: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def blank_square_form render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_form.html.erb&quot; }) end def calculate_square # params = {&quot;elephant&quot;=&gt;&quot;42&quot;} @num = params.fetch(&quot;elephant&quot;).to_f @square_of_num = @num * @num render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/square_results.html.erb&quot; }) end def calculate_random # params = {&quot;user_min&quot;=&gt;&quot;1.5&quot;, &quot;user_max&quot;=&gt;&quot;4.5&quot;} @lower = params.fetch(&quot;user_min&quot;).to_f @upper = params.fetch(&quot;user_max&quot;).to_f render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/random_results.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“19-22” } And then add these instance variables in the rendered view template: &lt;!-- app/views/calculation_templates/random_results.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;howdy&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Minimum&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @lower %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Maximum&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @upper %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Random Number&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Something&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; {: mark_lines=“5-14” } Something above is just a placeholder. I leave that to you to calculate in the action and place in the view template. But let’s refresh our new /random/results?user_min=1.5&amp;user_max=4.5 page. We see that indeed the URL query string has been parsed and turned into the instance variables which were then embedded in my view template. Try and just manually change the URL to /random/results?user_min=0&amp;user_max=2. The page will change when you hit enter and we never used the form page. So the two routes are independent. In theory, the savvy user could manually change the URL to get new results, but this isn’t so nice and we can’t expect our users to know how to do this. That’s why we use forms and wire things together. But remember: during the lifecycle of a given RCAV, only that route, action, and view template exist. Time for a /git commit, and a rails grade to see what’s left for you to do. 15.7.1 Text Companion: Independence of Routes "],["finish-and-submit-omnicalc-1.html", "15.8 Finish and Submit Omnicalc 1", " 15.8 Finish and Submit Omnicalc 1 Notes: Below are relevant notes for the rest of the project taken from the README 15.8.1 The Target The way the assignment should work is: If I visit the ROUTE /square/new, I should see a form with a label and an input to enter a number. If I submit that form, I should see the square of the number that I entered. If I visit the ROUTE /square_root/new, I should see a form with a label and an input to enter a number. If I submit that form, I should see the square root of the number that I entered. If I visit the ROUTE /payment/new, I should see a form with labels and inputs to enter three values: The APR (annual percentage rate). The number of years remaining. The present value. If I submit that form, I should see the monthly payment due given the values that I entered. Mind your units! Use this formula: Payment formula Hint 1: The number of periods, n, that we receive from the user is in years. Since we’re calculating monthly payment we multiply it by 12. Hint 2: apr comes in as a string. We should turn it into a float and divide the number by 100 to get the percentage. Hint 3: r in the formula is a percentage per period. One period is equal to one month. The apr we receive from the user is yearly. Hint 4: Create a variable for the numerator and another one for the denominator. If they are instance variables, you can view them within your view page. If your output does not match the target, having done this will make debugging much more manageable. If I visit the ROUTE /random/new, I should see a form with labels and inputs to enter two numbers, a minimum and a maximum. If I submit that form, I should see a random number that falls between the numbers that I entered. You can compare your app against the target, including doing “View Source” to look at some of the static HTML. 15.8.2 Valid, Accessible Forms In order for your tests to pass, you must build valid forms (your Chrome browser may tolerate invalid forms while you are manually testing, but automated test suites reject invalid forms): Each &lt;input&gt; in the form must have a unique id=\"\" attribute. The &lt;label&gt; associated with the &lt;input&gt; should have a for=\"\" attribute that matches the value of the &lt;input&gt;’s id. The copy within the &lt;label&gt; must exactly match the target — spelling, capitalization, and punctuation matter for labels. The same goes for the copy on the button to submit the form. Any invalid HTML within a form will cause the test to fail, e.g. an orphaned closing &lt;/div&gt; tag. Keep your code neatly indented to help avoid this. An example of a valid form; in particular, notice the id=\"\" and for=\"\" attributes: &lt;form action=&quot;/random/results&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;min_input&quot;&gt; Minimum &lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;min_input&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;user_min&quot; placeholder=&quot;E.g. 1.5&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;max_input&quot;&gt; Maximum &lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;max_input&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;user_max&quot; placeholder=&quot;E.g. 4.5&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;button&gt; Pick random number &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; 15.8.3 Additional Hints The to_s method can format Floats in more specific ways that help us easily display data in a variety of ways. In particular these two: .to_s(:currency) .to_s(:percentage) could be useful when formating the output of the payment form.

How do you connect a particular visit to a URL to a Ruby method, and then generate some dynamic HTML and send it back. So that will be the day today. Practicing that over and over. BENP: insert references to previous RCAV material here, like adding-routes.md and RCAV-flowchart.md This fortune teller project will be the first in a series of debugging projects. So rather than building up an app from scratch, we’ll start with a completed app that we have planted pernicious bugs in. You have to go through and figure out how to Read The Error Messages, RTEM. Again, RTEM is the most important skill to develop, not being able to just scan the code and spot what’s wrong. Let the error messages help you. If navigate to your app in the browser, you should be on the homepage /lottery/lucky which shows you five lucky numbers in a bulleted list. Each time we refresh, the numbers are changing. So this is a dynamic page and not a static page in the /public folder on GitPod. Let’s see what we are starting out with by going to our application on the GitPod workspace and opening our file config/routes.rb: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do # PART 1: EACH IN ERB # =================== get(&quot;/lottery/lucky&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;numbers&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;winners&quot; }) get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;numbers&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;winners&quot; }) # Let users visit URLs: # - /lottery/unlucky # PART 2: R→C→A→V DEBUGGING # ====================== # Uncomment each route below ONE AT A TIME and debug. # Do NOT uncomment more than one at a time, or you&#39;ll be dealing with multiple syntax errors at once. # get(&quot;/zodiacs/aries&quot;, { :controller =&gt; fire, action =&gt; &quot;ram&quot; }) # get(&quot;/zodiacs/leo&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;fire&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;lion&quot; }) # get(&quot;/zodiacs/sagittarius&quot; { :controller =&gt; &quot;fire&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;archer&quot; }) ... end BENP: not sure about the ... notation above to indicate code In many senses, this is the most important file. This is the list of all of the URLs that users are allowed to visit in our app, so it’s also a great place for us to start when we’re trying to get to know a new codebase. If we look at this we can see there are two routes users can currently visit /lottery/lucky and /. We can return to our browser and test those two URLs. They will bring us to the same lucky numbers page. But if I try to visit anything else, like if I click on any of the navbar links, all other URLs don’t work right now. One thing we notice right away is that both paths in our config/routes.rb are using the same controller and action: { :controller =&gt; \"numbers\", :action =&gt; \"winners\" }. And also, this controller called \"numbers\", is different from \"application\". The app/controllers/application_controller.rb is the file we have always used up to this point, as this is the ApplicationController that comes with every Rails application out-of-the-box. But, we can create our own controllers to keep things more organized. If you specify something after :controller =&gt; besides \"application\", like \"numbers\", then you need to create the file yourself in the app/controllers/ folder. If we navigate to that folder, we see we have six controllers now. application_controller.rb is in there, but if we open it we see it’s empty: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base end because we haven’t used it in our app. Instead if we open the \"numbers\" controller: # app/controllers/numbers_controller.rb class NumbersController &lt; ApplicationController ... end end We see that we’ve inherited (&lt;) from ApplicationController, so we get all the power – all the methods – that our ApplicationController inherited from the Rails ActionController::Base. ApplicationController is a “child” of ActionController::Base and ApplicationController is a “parent” of NumbersController. Written out that would look like NumbersController &lt; ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base. BENP: added that last two sentences based off some student questions in video This is a better way of organizing our controllers because in any standard app you are going to have dozens or hundreds of actions and ApplicationController would get cluttered if we put them all in the same file. We may ask, with multiple controllers, can we share data (e.g., instance variables with the @-notation) across the controllers? The answer is, not really. Because when someone visits a particular URL in our app, at that moment Rails goes and looks up a single controller action and runs it. At any given moment, only one route is every being used by a user. So it doesn’t matter if I have ten thousand actions in ApplicationController or spread across multiple child controllers, but they don’t need to every communicate with each other. The action is run, we send the HTML back, and the request is done until the user visits another route. 16.1.1 Text Companion: Routes and Controllers in Fortune Teller "],["video-segment-.each-loop-on-instance-variable.html", "16.2 Video Segment: .each Loop on @ Instance Variable", " 16.2 Video Segment: .each Loop on @ Instance Variable Notes: time stamp 00:10:50 to 00:17:37 from @zebra instance variable array to .each loop in the view template for /lottery/lucky embedded Ruby tags &lt;%= %&gt; vs. &lt;% %&gt; Okay, so as we saw in our config/routes.rb, the action triggered when visiting /lottery/lucky or / is called winners in our controller: # app/controllers/numbers_controller.rb class NumbersController &lt; ApplicationController def winners @zebra = Array.new 5.times do giraffe = rand(1...100) @zebra.push(giraffe) end render({ :template =&gt; &quot;lottery_stuff/woohoo.html.erb&quot;}) end end {: mark_lines=“4-14”} We chose to write this by first creating a new array (@zebra = Array.new), then we used the times method to generate a random number in a variable called giraffe and push the number into the @zebra array five times. There are other ways to do this, like creating five separate variables and putting a random number in each, that would have worked, but in this case I’m rendering the template \"lottery_stuff/woohoo.html.erb\", with only one instance variable, the array @zebra. Let’s look at that template in app/views/lottery_stuff: &lt;!-- app/views/lottery_stuff/woohoo.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Lucky numbers&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your lucky numbers for today are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;% @zebra.each do |elephant| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= elephant %&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; {: mark_lines=“8-12”} BENP: Again, notes about using elephant, zebra, giraffe. I wonder if it’s better to use thoughtful variable names from the beginning and avoid this. The crucial part is highlighted. In our .erb template, we are using .each on our instance variable array @zebra. Inside of the looping block, we write HTML to display the variable using the &lt;%= %&gt; embedded Ruby tag. We could name the block variable elephant whatever we want (as long as we change the name in the loop as well as between the pipes ||). It only exists in our loop and is not from the controller action. This instance variable loop-and-display technique is something we are going to be doing a lot. This is a main reason we spent all that time learning about .each. Very often we have records from a database table and we need to format and display those records with this technique. We could change the above code and see what happens. Let’s do this: &lt;!-- app/views/lottery_stuff/woohoo.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Lucky numbers&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your lucky numbers for today are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;%= @zebra.each do |elephant| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= elephant %&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; {: mark_lines=“8”} We added an = sign to the first embedded Ruby tag. Now if we refresh the app in our browser on the /lottery/lucky page, we will see the full array printed below our list, because we have made this previously invisible line (this tag: &lt;% %&gt;) visible (this tag: &lt;%= %&gt;). When done looping, .each returns the array itself when it is called. We don’t typically want or need to view this though. You can remove that added = sign from the HTML view template after you do this, because this line is not meant to be displayed, but rather to control the flow of our embedded Ruby. We already saw this with if statements for our Rock Paper Scissors RCAV project. 16.2.1 Text Companion: .each Loop on @ Instance Variable "],["video-segment-rcav-lotteryunlucky.html", "16.3 Video Segment: RCAV /lottery/unlucky", " 16.3 Video Segment: RCAV /lottery/unlucky Notes: time stamp 00:17:37 to 00:27:18 RCAV practice. re-do the /lottery/lucky but with different copy. try to type everything, avoid copy-paste Our first task in the README, was to study /lottery/lucky, and we’ve done that. Now let’s take a moment to build /lottery/unlucky. This is basically the same page, just with some different copy. Follow the usual RCAV. If you want a reference sheet you can have a look here. BENP: do we want that chapter linked still? We click the navbar or manually enter the URL to get to /lottery/unlucky, and we see the “No route matches” error. So we go into config/routes.rb and add that: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do # PART 1: EACH IN ERB # =================== get(&quot;/lottery/lucky&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;numbers&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;winners&quot; }) get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;numbers&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;winners&quot; }) get(&quot;/lottery/unlucky&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;numbers&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;losers&quot; }) # Let users visit URLs: # - /lottery/unlucky # PART 2: R→C→A→V DEBUGGING # ====================== # Uncomment each route below ONE AT A TIME and debug. # Do NOT uncomment more than one at a time, or you&#39;ll be dealing with multiple syntax errors at once. # get(&quot;/zodiacs/aries&quot;, { :controller =&gt; fire, action =&gt; &quot;ram&quot; }) # get(&quot;/zodiacs/leo&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;fire&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;lion&quot; }) # get(&quot;/zodiacs/sagittarius&quot; { :controller =&gt; &quot;fire&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;archer&quot; }) ... end {: mark_lines=“10”} Now we can refresh the browser and see we need to add the losers action to our controller: # app/controllers/numbers_controller.rb class NumbersController &lt; ApplicationController def losers end def winners @zebra = Array.new 5.times do giraffe = rand(1...100) @zebra.push(giraffe) end render({ :template =&gt; &quot;lottery_stuff/woohoo.html.erb&quot;}) end end {: mark_lines=“4-6”} Now it is up to you to complete the action code and render the result in a view template that will be very similar (though not identical) to app/views/lottery_stuff/woohoo.html.erb. Try to type everything out by yourself and avoid any copy-pasting. This is good practice! BENP: Break here where the students worked on this from 00:19:30 to 00:25:00 Let’s look at the completed action code: # app/controllers/numbers_controller.rb class NumbersController &lt; ApplicationController def losers @numbers = Array.new 5.times do a_number = rand(1...100) @numbers.push(a_number) end render({ :template =&gt; &quot;lottery_stuff/ohno.html.erb&quot;}) end def winners @zebra = Array.new 5.times do giraffe = rand(1...100) @zebra.push(giraffe) end render({ :template =&gt; &quot;lottery_stuff/woohoo.html.erb&quot;}) end end {: mark_lines=“5-13”} Note that we used some different variable names, and these are up to us to choose: @numbers for the array of random numbers and we call each individual number a_number. And we also can create the specified view template and filled it in. We start with this: &lt;!-- app/views/lottery_stuff/ohno.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Unluck numbers&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your unlucky numbers for today are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;%= @numbers %&gt; Now refreshing /lottery/unlucky should display our copy and our array of numbers with no formatting. Nice, almost there. Let’s add a loop and put our numbers into the proper format: &lt;!-- app/views/lottery_stuff/ohno.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Unluck numbers&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your unlucky numbers for today are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;%= @numbers.each do |num| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= num %&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; {: mark_lines=“7-12”} And now /lottery/unlucky should match the target. Test it manually to see, and when you’ve done that… Time for a /git commit, and maybe even a rails grade to see what’s left to do. 16.3.1 Text Companion: RCAV /lottery/unlucky "],["video-segment-navbar-and-zodiac-debugging.html", "16.4 Video Segment: Navbar and Zodiac Debugging", " 16.4 Video Segment: Navbar and Zodiac Debugging Notes: time stamp 00:27:18 to 00:36:30 aside to app/views/layouts/application.html.erb to show debug /zodiacs/aries together RTEM In the target, there are three navbar sections. We already did the top lottery section. There are twelve links in the horoscopes section. If you click the link you will see that each displays some text and then lucky numbers again. Below the horoscipes there is a section for dice, which simulates rolling a certain number of dice with a certain number of sides. For instance, “5d6” means roll five six-sided dice. In our app (not the target), none of the horoscope or dice links work. Here’s your task. First, the required part of this homework is debugging the 12 zodiacs. There are already links and routes. BENP: An aside starts below, could be moved elsehwere By the way, where does all the navbar HTML come from? In the templates we made (e.g., app/views/lottery_stuff/woohoo.html.erb), we did not include any header information in the HTML code. That’s because all of this is in the wrapper file, specifically app/views/layouts/application.html.erb: &lt;!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb --&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Fortune Teller&lt;/title&gt; &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt; &lt;!-- Expand the number of characters we can use in the document beyond basic ASCII  --&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Make it responsive to small screens --&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no&quot;&gt; &lt;%= csp_meta_tag %&gt; &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &#39;application&#39;, media: &#39;all&#39; %&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;nav&gt; ... &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Where we have the ..., you should see all of the navbar links in an HTML table, which is applied as a header to all of our pages. The pages are placed where we see the &lt;%= yield %&gt; tag. This app/views/layouts/application.html.erb file that comes with every Rails app is where you would place anything that you want on all of your pages. Okay, back to the zodiac debugging. If we go to our routes, we will see: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do # PART 1: EACH IN ERB # =================== get(&quot;/lottery/lucky&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;numbers&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;winners&quot; }) get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;numbers&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;winners&quot; }) get(&quot;/lottery/unlucky&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;numbers&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;losers&quot; }) # Let users visit URLs: # - /lottery/unlucky # PART 2: R→C→A→V DEBUGGING # ====================== # Uncomment each route below ONE AT A TIME and debug. # Do NOT uncomment more than one at a time, or you&#39;ll be dealing with multiple syntax errors at once. # get(&quot;/zodiacs/aries&quot;, { :controller =&gt; fire, action =&gt; &quot;ram&quot; }) # get(&quot;/zodiacs/leo&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;fire&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;lion&quot; }) # get(&quot;/zodiacs/sagittarius&quot; { :controller =&gt; &quot;fire&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;archer&quot; }) ... end {: mark_lines=“22-24”} And we can just begin uncommenting (remove the leading # from the line) each route and debugging them one at a time. Uncomment each route ONE AT A TIME and debug it ONE AT A TIME. Don’t uncomment multiple at once, or you’ll have multiple syntax errors at once and the error messages can’t help you. Let’s begin by uncommenting get(\"/zodiacs/aries\", { :controller =&gt; fire, action =&gt; \"ram\" }) and then in our app try to visit the given path: /zodiacs/aries. Now RTEM: There&#39;s a problem with your routes.rb file. unrecognized `fire&#39; . So let’s look at our routes file, and what do we see? Oops, where is says :controller =&gt; fire, it should say :controller =&gt; \"fire\", with string quotation marks. Without the quotations, Ruby thinks fire is a local variable because it begins with a lowercase letter. But we never defined a variable called fire, that is the name we assigned to our controller and we have a controller file called app/controllers/fire_controller.rb, which is what we want Rails to look for. Okay, we made this change and now we refresh our browser on /zodiacs/aries, and we get a new error: There&#39;s a problem with your routes.rb file. unrecognized `aciton&#39; . Did you mean? action_path Because in our route we have action =&gt; \"ram\", which should be :action =&gt; \"ram\", adding a colon to make action into a symbol in the hash. And refresh /zodiacs/aries again, and another error to deal with: ActionController::RoutingError at /zodiacs/aries uninitialized constant FireController Did you mean? FiresController AirController Hmm. This means we have not defined the class FireController. So let’s look in our app/controllers/ directory and we see a controller called fires_controller.rb. There is an extra s on fires, whereas we wrote in our route: :controller =&gt; \"fire\". So rename the controller to fire_controller.rb and refresh again /zodiacs/aries, and we succeeded! One thing to note. If you think you did everything correctly but are still getting error messages, then go to GitPod, shut down your server in the terminal by using Ctrl + C, and restart with bin/server. This sometimes happens with filename or foldername changes. Time for a /git commit, and maybe even a rails grade to see what’s left to do. And now you can proceed on your own with the config/routes.rb file as we’ve done above. Uncomment, RTEM, and proceed. 16.4.1 Text Companion: Navbar and Zodiac Debugging "],["finish-and-submit-fortune-teller.html", "16.5 Finish and Submit Fortune Teller", " 16.5 Finish and Submit Fortune Teller Notes: Below are relevant notes for the rest of the project taken from the README 16.5.1 Debugging checklist READ the error message. Extract as much useful information from it as possible. If there’s no error message, find another way to give yourself feedback; make the invisible visible. Use the server log. Print things; in this new world, that means use embedded Ruby tags (&lt;%= %&gt;) in the view templates. We can’t use the p method anymore since we aren’t writing command line programs anymore. If all else fails — the error message isn’t helpful, or there isn’t one and you can’t spot the issue visually — delete the offending code (or comment it out), and re-type the R→C→A→V from scratch. Hopefully you’ve been making lots of git commits, so there’s no fear in doing so. 16.5.2 More RCAV Practice In the nav, there are links to 18 pages that simulate rolling dice in various combinations that are useful for board games (six-sided dice, from one die up to six dice) and other, more exotic dice combinations that are useful for e.g. Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Right now, none of those URLs work; and the routes don’t even exist. Implement them, one at a time. Try to type them out rather than copy-pasting; the point is to build muscle memory and encounter error messages in a controlled setting. There are no automated tests for Part 3; this is just extra reps for practice. 16.5.3 Reflections Of the error messages that you encountered during debugging, which ones were most helpful? Which ones were least helpful? In this project, the subfolders within app/views/ that we store our ERB templates in had various different suffixes: app/views/lottery_stuff/ app/views/flame_interface/ app/views/nature_templates/ app/views/wind_html/ app/views/aqua/ (no suffix) If you had to pick one style for us to use consistently in the future, which do you prefer? Or can you think of a different subfolder naming convention that you would prefer more? You now know how to respond to visits to URLs with dynamically generated HTML. This is, fundamentally, how Twitter, GitHub, Basecamp, NYTimes, Airbnb, and every other web application works. But, of course, we have a lot more to learn before we could build, for example, a social network. What are we still missing? What are you most curious to learn next?

The first layer of building a dynamic application is connecting the Route, Controller, Action, View. Having some variables displayed on the page so it is dynamic and not static HTML. The second thing we need to do is accept information from our users because just generating random stuff on a page is boring, so we’ll be building tons and tons of forms for the rest of the quarter. Omnicalc 2 is very similar to Omnicalc 1, where you began to learn forms in that homework. In this case, if I have a look at config/routes.rb, the file is empty: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html end So will need to build up the target step-by-step. When you open this app, you need to enter a username (appdev) and password (fullstack). The reason for this, is because, if we have time, we’re going to do some more fun things than we’ve done so far. Instead of just getting numbers and doing some math, we’ll be doing some more fun things. For example if we look in the target, there’s a “Street to Coordinates” calculator. If you type in and address here, like “5807 S Woodlawn Ave” and click “Lookup Coordinates”, then it displays latitude and longitude. So all the form entry steps are the same as what you’ve already done, but the application does much more here. How did we get from a street address to these coordinates? What’s the Ruby for that? Well, we’re going to learn how to do that. Even more cool, there’s a link in the target called “Translate”. Ff we fill out this form, maybe with “Ruby is the best!” in the first box, and then select a language from the second drop down menu (e.g., Chinese (simplified)), and put in a phone number in the last box with the country code (e.g., +1 for USA), and finally hit translate, then the text gets translated and the number we entered gets a text message with that translation! It’s still all about entering in forms, but the way we achieve these responses is very empowering. This is known as Application Programming Interface, or API, programming. This means that other companies, like Google, will allow us to Create, Read, Update, and Delete information in their databases, and they will send back information that they have. We don’t need to create their data, we can use their resources. Both the street to coordinates and translation service above is provided by Google (actually the text messaging part is another company called Twilio). We also have link to “Street to Weather” or “Coordinates to Weather”. These use two APIs, one for Google to get the location, and the second is the DarkSky API to get back a detailed weather forecast. 17.1.1 Text Companion: Exploring the Target "],["video-segment-reviewing-query-strings.html", "17.2 Video Segment: Reviewing Query Strings", " 17.2 Video Segment: Reviewing Query Strings Notes: time stamp 00:42:54 to 00:50:45 examine target /wizard_add and implement using query string and params All that said, the important goal of this project (and the required part) is building forms, so let’s do one of the four forms together now: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide. We will focus on the “Add” form. Let’s visit /add in our Rails app browser. As expected we get a “No route matches” error. So we will need to build this up step-by-step. But first, observe the target app. In each calculator there are two actions. There is one action that just displays the form. Then when I fill out the form and press the button, it takes me to a different URL. If we fill out “Add” with “4” in the first number and “10” in the second, then press the button, the resulting URL on the “Addition” page looks like /wizard_add?first_num=4&amp;second_num=10. Any of the other forms on our target works this same way: the information we put in the form is placed as variables in the URL query string preceded by the ? character. If I know how this form works, I can just type directly into the URL with new variable values, and I will get a new result. I never even need to visit the form page. I want to emphasize here, the form and second action that does the work are two totally separate independent actions. We use forms because we want a nice interface for our users. It is polite to add a form for our users, who are not developers like us. We’ll implement /add now, but we will go backwards. First, I’m going to implement the second step /wizard_add: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/wizard_add&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;math&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;add_results&quot; }) # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html end {: mark_lines=“5”} My selection for the :controller and :action names above, mean I’ll need to create these in out app. So in the app/controllers/ folder we need to make a new file math_controller.rb and fill it in with our inherited ApplicationController functionality and our new action: # app/controllers/math_controller.rb class MathController &lt; ApplicationController def add_results render({ :template =&gt; &quot;math_templates/add_results.html.erb&quot; }) end end And our selection to just render some HTML, means that we also need to create the view template. So in the app/views/ folder we need to first make a new folder math_templates/ and then a new file in that folder called add_results.html.erb. And in this file we can put some placeholder text to render: &lt;!-- app/views/math_templates/add_results.html.erb --&gt; hi Now if we didn’t make any typos and visit or refresh /wizard_add, we will see our rendered HTML. You will also already see a navbar, that we included in the app, and this, as you have already seen, is in the app/views/layout/application.html.erb file that is applied to every page. Now if a user includes a query string in the URL, like /wizard_add?zebra=bob, there is no effect on the routing when we press enter. But if we look into our server log in the GitPod terminal tab running your server (Cmd-K or Ctrl-K to clear it out), we can find: ... HTML Parameters: {&quot;zebra&quot;=&gt;&quot;bob&quot;} Rendering math_templates/add_results.html.erb Rendered math_templates/add_results.html.erb within layouts/application ... Our query string that is automatically split, parsed, and added to params. All before I have built the form. Let’s use the expected query string: /wizard_add?first_num=4&amp;second_num=10. And observe now in the server log: ... HTML Parameters: {&quot;first_num&quot;=&gt;&quot;4&quot;, &quot;second_num&quot;=&gt;&quot;10&quot;} Rendering math_templates/add_results.html.erb Rendered math_templates/add_results.html.erb within layouts/application ... {: mark_lines=“3”} We can now pull out this information in our action: # app/controllers/math_controller.rb class MathController &lt; ApplicationController def add_result @first = params.fetch(&quot;first_num&quot;) @second = params.fetch(&quot;second_num&quot;) @result = @first + @second render({ :template =&gt; &quot;math_templates/add_results.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“5-9”} And display the instance variables on our view template: &lt;!-- app/views/math_templates/add_results.html.erb --&gt; &lt;%= @result %&gt; {: mark_lines=“3”} And if we now refresh /wizard_add?first_num=4&amp;second_num=10, we see the result displayed as “410”. Why? Because we are adding two strings in our action! We need to remember to convert them to floats or integers to do math on them: # app/controllers/math_controller.rb class MathController &lt; ApplicationController def add_results @first = params.fetch(&quot;first_num&quot;).to_f @second = params.fetch(&quot;second_num&quot;).to_f @result = @first + @second render({ :template =&gt; &quot;math_templates/add_results.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“5 7”} And now we should get “14.0” on our page. We won’t flesh out all the copy and formatting to get our HTML view template to match the target page, but this should be straightforward. 17.2.1 Text Companion: Reviewing Query Strings "],["video-segment-reviewing-forms.html", "17.3 Video Segment: Reviewing Forms", " 17.3 Video Segment: Reviewing Forms Notes: time stamp 00:50:45 to 00:58:00 examine target /add and implement using forms Our results page works, but it’s a pain for our users to type in the URL query string. If they make any mistake like typing “first_number” instead of “first_num”, like /wizard_add?first_number=4&amp;second_num=10, they would get the error: param is missing or the value is empty: first_num because in our add_result action in our MathController, we have @first = params.fetch(\"first_num\").to_f. But \"first_num\" does not exist in our params variable, because the user accidentally named it first_number in the URL. Hence, we need a form for the user to type into. So the usual RCAV here: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/add&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;math&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;add_form&quot; }) get(&quot;/wizard_add&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;math&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;add_results&quot; }) # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html end {: mark_lines=“5”} Then: # app/controllers/math_controller.rb class MathController &lt; ApplicationController def add_form render({ :template =&gt; &quot;math_templates/add_form.html.erb&quot; }) end def add_results @first = params.fetch(&quot;first_num&quot;).to_f @second = params.fetch(&quot;second_num&quot;).to_f @result = @first + @second render({ :template =&gt; &quot;math_templates/add_results.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“4-6”} Put some copy in the new view template we create: &lt;!-- app/views/math_templates/add_form.html.erb --&gt; hi And when we see our URL /add loads with no error, we can put together our form in the view template to finish things off: &lt;!-- app/views/math_templates/add_form.html.erb --&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/wizard_add&quot;&gt; &lt;input name=&quot;first_num&quot;&gt; &lt;input name=&quot;second_num&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt; Add &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“3-11”} The all important action=\"/wizard_add\" attribute in the opening &lt;form&gt; tag, tells the form that when we click the &lt;button&gt;, then route to /wizard_add, which activates the first RCAV we built to do the computation. This is the most basic, working version of the form, but you will need to add a lot more like the input labels. Of course, we want a valid form, so you will need to include the matching for=\"\" and id=\"\" attributes for each &lt;label&gt; and associated &lt;input&gt;, and make sure everything matches the target. BENP: could link to forms-query-strings-and-params.md chapter or whatever that content becomes Complete the rest of the assignment on your own and make sure to be /git committing anytime you get something working with rails grade. You will need to wire up all RCAVs and the associated forms for “Add”, “Subtract”, “Divide”, and “Mulitply”. BENP: From below, I think a new chapter /recording / chapter is in order. 17.3.1 Text Companion: Reviewing Forms "],["video-segment-intro-to-apis-with-street-to-coordinates.html", "17.4 Video Segment: Intro to APIs with Street to Coordinates", " 17.4 Video Segment: Intro to APIs with Street to Coordinates Notes: time stamp 01:00:00 to 01:21:00 there is a bunch of explanation here about APIs implementing /experiment for “Street to Coordinates” API keys JSON Google Maps API JSON to Hash with JSON.parse(open(@url).read) Let’s begin to experiment with APIs in our app. One of the homework videos for next week includes some API work, but we will get a taste here.

And here is a bunch of handy links (BENP: originally from README, can we remove some links? yes definitely) with information on APIs: JSONView Chrome extension Dark Sky forecast at the Merchandise Mart for humans Dark Sky forecast at the Merchandise Mart for machines: https://api.darksky.net/forecast/REPLACE_THIS_PATH_SEGMENT_WITH_YOUR_API_TOKEN/41.8887,-87.6355 Dark Sky API docs Map of Merchandise Mart for humans Map of Merchandise Mart for machines: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Merchandise%20Mart%20Chicago&amp;key=REPLACE_THIS_QUERY_STRING_PARAMETER_WITH_YOUR_API_TOKEN Google Geocoding API docs How to store secrets securely on Gitpod If we look at the target and navigate to “Street to Coordinates”, BENP: video cuts out … the reason for that is, it costs money. Each time we’re making an API call, they are tracking our use and charging us if we are above some limit. GoogleMaps has a very high limit of API calls before charging begins, but the text messaging in the “Translate” page costs money for every message. That is why we have password secured the target in this case. So this is something to keep in mind: if you start to play around with APIs and sign up for an account with a credit card, then be careful with your API credentials! In this project any necessary API credentials are made available to you BENP: these are from Canvas and probably should not be / or should be changed in the final material. ALL API KEYS LABELLED AS TODO: TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID : TODO TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN : TODO TWILIO_SENDING_PHONE_NUMBER : TODO MAILGUN_API_KEY : TODO MAILGUN_SENDING_DOMAIN : TODO GMAPS_KEY : TODO DARK_SKY_KEY : TODO TRANSLATE_PROJECT : omnicalc TRANSLATE_CREDENTIALS : { TODO } So you can feel free to play around. But with your own credentials, be careful and protect them. BENP: could link to storing-credentials-securely.md content here How do I begin to think about tackling “Street to Coordinates”? I have an address and I want the latitude and longitude. I don’t want to use my company resources to building up a huge database of this information that I can lookup in. So let’s use Google’s Geocoding API. The first step of any API work is doing some homework. Search around on the internet for different options and read through some of the documentation. If we look around in the Google documentation, we would find a URL: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA&amp;key=YOUR_API_KEY What do we see? We have an address: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json and a query string: ?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA&amp;key=YOUR_API_KEY. And we can see the query string includes an address= variable, and a key= variable. If we try to visit the URL as it is, we would see a page like: // 20221217132605 // https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA&amp;key=YOUR_API_KEY { &quot;error_message&quot;: &quot;The provided API key is invalid. &quot;, &quot;results&quot;: [ ], &quot;status&quot;: &quot;REQUEST_DENIED&quot; } We see an error message. Because we need to replace YOUR_API_KEY, with our API key! So we can go into a new tab and try to do that with our GMAPS_KEY BENP: this key is expired and needs to be changed everywhere above and below: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA&amp;key=TODO And when we enter this address in the tab, we should see a very long JSON file displayed in our browser, something like: // 20221217131844 // https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA&amp;key=TODO { &quot;results&quot;: [ { &quot;address_components&quot;: ... } ... ] } There may be several hundred lines displayed and it may not be broken into readable lines if you don’t have a third party extension like JSON Viewer for Chrome. If you examine the page, you will see lots of information about the address we entered. JSON, or Javascript Object Notation, is not the same format as HTML. JSON is somewhat similar to CSV, and there is another format called XML that many APIs use. These are all just different data formats that are much easier to parse programmatically compared to HTML. If I change the query string in my URL to whatever I want (even with spaces): https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=5807 S Woodlawn Ave&amp;key=TODO Then the JSON information will change to give me information on that address 5807 S Woodlawn Ave. If I look carefully and scroll down, I could even find the following: ... &quot;location&quot;: { &quot;lat&quot;: 41.7891387, &quot;lng&quot;: -87.5954555 }, ... Ahh, just what we needed to display on our “Street to Coordinates” result page! Wow, APIs seem intimidating, but in reality it’s just a URL that we provide and we get back information from a database owned by some company. Once we get to the stage of entering a URL with some form data and receiving a response, then it’s actually pretty simple to finish our app. Now it’s time to actually get our form and results working. We’ll start by just copying our working URL into the experiment action in our GitPod app: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def experiment @url = &quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=5807 S Woodlawn Ave&amp;key=TODO&quot; render({ :template =&gt; &quot;math_templates/experiment.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“5”} (You may see %20 characters in the place of the URL spaces we put in, like 5807%20S%20Woodlawn%20Ave. You can copy those in too, they just mean “space”.) And now we can use some cool methods for opening (open built into Ruby): # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def experiment @url = &quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=5807 S Woodlawn Ave&amp;key=TODO&quot; @raw = open(@url) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;math_templates/experiment.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“7”} Now if we open our view template and inject this instance variable in: &lt;!-- app/views/math_templates/experiment.html.erb --&gt; &lt;%= @raw %&gt; {: mark_lines=“3”} then load the URL /experiment in our app browser, we will see “#” or something similar. This is an object of class String, which contains that page. We can call another method on this in the view template: &lt;!-- app/views/math_templates/experiment.html.erb --&gt; &lt;%= @raw.read %&gt; {: mark_lines=“3”} which will get the body of the page and return is as a string when we refresh the browser. This will be the entire (long) JSON string. We can put all this into the action: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def experiment @url = &quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=5807 S Woodlawn Ave&amp;key=TODO&quot; @raw = open(@url).read render({ :template =&gt; &quot;math_templates/experiment.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“7”} We could now remove the .read from our HTML view template. We can go into our action and change address=5807 S Woodlawn Ave in the URL to whatever we want (e.g., address=Miami FL), and if we refresh /experiment then we will see the JSON changing. The page now dynamically reacts using information from the Google API. Now, we can also parse the JSON (which is currently just a long String variable) to get just the information we want. We don’t want to directly parse the string (e.g., with .split()). There is a much better way: we can convert it into a Hash using the built in class JSON and one of its methods, parse(), to convert it to a Hash. Then we can take our Hash, bury through the key/value pairs (there are Hashes within the Hash!), and figure out where the latitude and longitude values are to then pull out (.fetch()) as instance variables and put on our webpage. Alltogether that looks like: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def experiment @url = &quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=5807 S Woodlawn Ave&amp;key=TODO&quot; @raw = open(@url).read @parsed = JSON.parse(@raw) # parsed is now a Hash class # and we bury down into the hash with the key/value pairs # to get what we want @results = @parsed.fetch(&quot;results&quot;) @geom = @results.fetch(&quot;geometry&quot;) @loc = @geom.fetch(&quot;location&quot;) @lat = @loc.fetch(&quot;lat&quot;) @lng = @loc.fetch(&quot;lng&quot;) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;math_templates/experiment.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“9-17”} And display that in our experiment template: &lt;!-- app/views/math_templates/experiment.html.erb --&gt; Latitude &lt;%= @lat %&gt;, Longitude &lt;%= @lng %&gt; {: mark_lines=“3”} Now, we hard-coded an address 5807 S Woodlawn Ave into our experiment action in the @url variable, so we would need this to come from an associated input form so the user could change this string. That is not required, but is good practice if you implement it. 17.4.1 Text Companion: Intro to APIs with Street to Coordinates "],["finish-and-submit-omnicalc-2.html", "17.5 Finish and Submit Omnicalc 2", " 17.5 Finish and Submit Omnicalc 2 Notes: Below are relevant notes for the rest of the project taken from the README API stretch goal should maybe go in a separate place?

Something that might or might not be useful: the Time.at method. (Humans have many, many different ways of representing dates. For the purposes of different pieces of software being able to agree on dates and times, most systems when talking to each other use Epoch time notation, or the number of seconds that have passed since midnight UTC on January 1st (minus leap seconds). Dark Sky, for example, includes times in this format. You can use Time.at() to convert to something more familiar, if you want to.) Put all of the pieces together; given an arbitrary address: print the current temperature print outlook for the next hour print whether a person should carry an umbrella. 17.5.3 Using gems to interact with APIs Notes: from https://github.com/appdev-targets/omnicalc-2-api-starting-point#using-gems-to-interact-with-apis Interacting with APIs can be easier if someone has written a Ruby library (or “gem”) with methods that already know the URLs, parse the JSON, and return exactly the values we want. 17.5.3.1 Twilio In your Gemfile, add: gem &quot;twilio-ruby&quot; Then, at a Terminal prompt: bundle install You will then have access to the Twilio::REST::Client class. It is used like this: # Retrieve your credentials from secure storage twilio_sid = ENV.fetch(&quot;TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID&quot;) twilio_token = ENV.fetch(&quot;TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN&quot;) twilio_sending_number = ENV.fetch(&quot;TWILIO_SENDING_PHONE_NUMBER&quot;) # Create an instance of the Twilio Client and authenticate with your API key twilio_client = Twilio::REST::Client.new(twilio_sid, twilio_token) # Craft your SMS as a Hash with three keys sms_parameters = { :from =&gt; twilio_sending_number, :to =&gt; &quot;+19876543210&quot;, # Put your own phone number here if you want to see it in action :body =&gt; &quot;It&#39;s going to rain today — take an umbrella!&quot; } # Send your SMS! twilio_client.api.account.messages.create(sms_parameters) Sign up for your own Twilio account — if use this referral link you’ll $10 in credit, and so will our class account.

Add the gem to your Gemfile: # /Gemfile gem &quot;google-cloud-translate&quot;, &quot;2.3.0&quot; Then bundle install and restart your web server. You now have access to the Google::Cloud::Translate class.

So, in the code you’re starting with, the horoscopes from Part 2 of fortune-teller have already been debugged, and the dice from Part 3 of fortune-teller have already been built out. In refactoring-fortune-teller, our goal is to keep everything working exactly the same way that it is; we’re not going to add much. But we’re going to get rid of 90% of the lines of code, while keeping the functionality the same. How? With dynamic route segments. Consider our new target: https://refactoring-fortune-teller.matchthetarget.com/roll/2/6 Seems like the same thing that we had before, right? Well, try this URL instead: https://refactoring-fortune-teller.matchthetarget.com/roll/42/1337 That’s a lot of 1337-sided dice. Try any combination of two numbers you want in the second and third segments of the path. You’ll see that they all work! Obviously, I didn’t just happen to add routes for the exact pairs of numbers you chose. Instead, there’s only one route handling all of the dice rolls; it matches URLs that starts with /roll/ and have two more segments, but allows any values to appear in the last two segments. In the action, Rails allows us to examine what values were in those spots, and customize the response accordingly. How do we get access to the values? Through our old friend, the params hash! Let’s see how: First, in your own app, try visiting a URL like this: /roll/2/6 It should work. First, follow the R→C→A→V through and familiarize yourself with the code. Now, try visiting a URL like this: /roll/42/513 You will get a “no route matches” error. Let’s first make it so that users can visit any URL of the form /roll/X/Y and it will not throw an error, no matter what X and Y are: If we set up a route like this (for now let’s send it to the existing two_six action): BENP: Why not :dice and :sides in place of :zebra and :giraffe? I see this is done later, but maybe just do it right away to compress the section a bit further. This follows my notes in Fortune Teller Part1. get(&quot;/roll/:zebra/:giraffe&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;dice&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;two_six&quot; }) and then try visiting /roll/42/513 again, the route does match, and you get sent to the old action for two six-sided dice. What happens if you change the route to: get(&quot;/roll/zebra/giraffe&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;dice&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;two_six&quot; }) (removing the colons before zebra and giraffe) and visit /roll/42/513 again? “No route matches.” Ok, put the colons back: get(&quot;/roll/:zebra/:giraffe&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;dice&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;two_six&quot; }) So, by beginning a segment of a path with a colon, we’re making it dynamic. Rails will, for the purpose of routing, allow anything there; it’s like a wildcard. Now, watch your server log while visiting the URL: Parameters: { &quot;zebra&quot; =&gt; &quot;42&quot;, &quot;giraffe&quot; =&gt; &quot;513&quot; } It’s just like when we got inputs from the query string! Except, in this case, the keys in the hash were determined by us in advance, in the route; rather than being tacked on to the end of the URL itself by the visitor (or a form). Try visiting the following URL paths in your browser: /roll/alice/bob /roll/42/513/alice /42/513 Which ones throw a “no route matches” error and which ones don’t? What appears in the params hash in your server log?28 Okay, from here, we .fetch the data from the params hash, just as we did before when learning about query strings. Let’s make up a new action, instead of messing with two_six; and let’s use more meaningful labels for the dynamic segments than :zebra and :giraffe: BENP: see previous zebra note. Could remove above text and below code get(&quot;/roll/:number_of_dice/:how_many_sides&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;dice&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;infinity_and_beyond&quot; }) Now, when we visit /roll/42/513, we get a “missing action” error, as expected. Let’s define the infinity_and_beyond action and make it say “hi” as usual: # app/controllers/dice_controller.rb class DiceController &lt; ApplicationController def infinity_and_beyond render({template =&gt; &quot;dice_templates/infinity.html.erb&quot;}) end # ... BENP: Above: I have used ... rather than # ... in other code blocks. Will need to be changed. &lt;%# app/views/dice_templates/infinity.html.erb %&gt; &lt;h1&gt;hi&lt;/h1&gt; BENP: Above and throughout, we have a specific erb code style? I have just been using html in previous transcription docs. These may need to be changed here or in my notes. Test it out and make sure you wired up your R→C→A→V correctly; if not, read the error messages, RTEM, and debug. Now, let’s .fetch the information from the params hash that we need to make this response intelligent: # app/controllers/dice_controller.rb class DiceController &lt; ApplicationController def infinity_and_beyond @num_dice = params.fetch(&quot;number_of_dice&quot;) @num_faces = params.fetch(&quot;how_many_sides&quot;) render({template =&gt; &quot;dice_templates/infinity.html.erb&quot;}) end # ... {: mark_lines=“5-6”} I made the variables instances variables instead of local variables, by starting them with @, under the assumption that I will want to use them in the view template. And we can use logic similar to the logic in all the other actions to actually create an array of “dice rolls”: # app/controllers/dice_controller.rb class DiceController &lt; ApplicationController def infinity_and_beyond @num_dice = params.fetch(&quot;number_of_dice&quot;) @num_faces = params.fetch(&quot;how_many_sides&quot;) @array_of_rolls = Array.new @num_dice.to_i.times do @array_of_rolls.push(rand(@num_faces.to_i) + 1) end render({template =&gt; &quot;dice_templates/infinity.html.erb&quot;}) end # ... {: mark_lines=“8 10-12”} and then draw them in the template: &lt;%# app/views/dice_templates/infinity.html.erb %&gt; &lt;h1&gt; &lt;%= @num_dice %&gt;d&lt;%= @num_faces %&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;% @array_of_rolls.each do |a_roll| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= a_roll %&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; {: mark_lines=“3-14”} And, voilà, it should work — and it should work for any combination of dice and faces! Including the 18 combinations that we had before. Comment out all the old routes and click on all the links in the nav — they still work! Gleefully, delete all the old routes, actions, and view templates — we love deleting code. That’s less costly code to maintain. But wait! Are you sure you didn’t forget and break some old functionality that we had before? How can we be sure? A question to ponder. Did you actually go visit those URLs? Why not? Do or do not; there is no read.↩︎ "],["part-2-horoscopes.html", "18.2 Part 2: Horoscopes", " 18.2 Part 2: Horoscopes Notes: dynamic route segments, our own classes Copied from refactoring-fortune-teller-with-dynamic-routes.md chapter section Zodiac class in app/models/ get(\"/zodiacs/:the_sign\", { :controller =&gt; \"fortunes\", :action =&gt; \"horoscopes\" }) String#to_sym regressions and refactoring, importance of automated tests Let’s try to do something similar for the zodiacs; that is, let’s see if we can use a dynamic route segment to reduce the amount of code. It won’t be quite as straightforward as with the dice, because there’s actual data (the horoscopes) that isn’t the same on each page; it’s not as formulaic as generating random numbers based on the ones that are in the URL. But, if we had a way to look up the horoscope given the astrological sign that’s in the URL, then the rest of every action would be the same. Generate lucky numbers, and populate a template that’s the same for every action. Imagine you had a hash of hashes that had all of the signs and horoscopes within it, something like an API response — then could you make a single RCAV that supported all 12 zodiacs? If you had a hash like this available to you: { :aries =&gt; { :name =&gt; &quot;Aries&quot;, :horoscope =&gt; &quot;As your professional dreams unfold, Aries, you may worry about the downside. First, there are new responsibilities that you might doubt your ability to fulfill. Second, you might be catapulted into an uncomfortable new realm of office politics. Don&#39;t let these matters put a damper on your enthusiasm. You have what it takes to fulfill the first concern and the wisdom to avoid the second. Onward and upward.&quot; }, :leo =&gt; { :name =&gt; &quot;Leo&quot;, :horoscope =&gt; &quot;Success on all levels is filling your life and making you feel absolutely wonderful, Leo. The downside of this is that you might be a little too conscientious. Are you putting in a lot of extra hours? Be discriminating about this and don&#39;t work harder than necessary. You could get stressed to the point of taxing your strength too much, and that won&#39;t help you. Pace yourself.&quot; }, # etc } Fortunately, you do. I’ve created a class called Zodiac, and I gave it class-level method called list which returns that exact hash above29. Give the Zodiac class a try. For example, in the FireController#ram action, you can replace: @horoscope = &quot;As your professional dreams unfold, Aries, you may worry about the downside. First, there are new responsibilities that you might doubt your ability to fulfill. Second, you might be catapulted into an uncomfortable new realm of office politics. Don&#39;t let these matters put a damper on your enthusiasm. You have what it takes to fulfill the first concern and the wisdom to avoid the second. Onward and upward.&quot; With: all_zodiacs = Zodiac.list this_zodiac = all_zodiacs.fetch(:aries) @horoscope = this_zodiac.fetch(:horoscope) Verify that your /zodiacs/aries action still works just like before. If you’re curious, the Zodiac class is in the app/models/ folder — you can go have a look at it, if you like. When we want to define a new Ruby class within a Rails app, we create a file for it in the app/models/ folder. The filename is important — it should exactly match the class name, but lowercased BENP: snake_cased instead of lowercased?, just like when we create controller classes (e.g., fire_controller.rb containing FireController). In this case, I created a file called zodiac.rb within app/models/, and boom — everywhere within the Rails application (all controllers, all views, even within other models), we have access to the Zodiac class; and we can call Zodiac.list. We’ll talk a lot more about models in the coming weeks, but for now you can just use the Zodiac.list method I provided; just know that it returns a hash of hashes with the keys as shown above. You know how to work with hashes. Now, your task is: with what you’ve learned about dynamic route segments, and with the ability to look up a horoscope given a sign, can you replace all 12 of the R→C→A→Vs for zodiacs with just one R→C→A→V? get(&quot;/zodiacs/:the_sign&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;fortunes&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;horoscopes&quot; }) You can pick whatever controller and action name you like, but when you’re done the application should function exactly the same as before. 18.2.1 String#to_sym If we try to access an element in a Hash that looks like this: zodiacs = { :aries =&gt; &quot;stuff&quot;, :leo =&gt; &quot;more stuff&quot;, } with a String key \"leo\": zodiacs.fetch(&quot;leo&quot;) we’ll get the familiar error message: KeyError (key not found: &quot;leo&quot;) because the String, \"leo\", is not the same as the Symbol, :leo. Remember that all values in the params hash come to us as Strings. Just as we had to convert these Strings to Floats with .to_f before doing math on them in Omnicalc, we’ll have to convert them to Symbols if we want to use them to key into the Hash returned by Zodiac.list. Fortunately, there’s a handy method .to_sym that will do just that: &quot;hello&quot;.to_sym # =&gt; :hello With the .to_sym method in hand, you should be able to use params and Zodiac.list to replace all 12 actions with 1! Can you define a class and a class-level method like this? You ought to be able to, with what you’ve learned about Our own classes and Hashes.↩︎ "],["regressions.html", "18.3 Regressions", " 18.3 Regressions How can you be sure that it functions exactly the same as before?

"],["refactoring.html", "18.4 Refactoring", " 18.4 Refactoring What we just did is called refactoring: In computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality. Potential advantages of refactoring may include improved code readability and reduced complexity; these can improve the source code’s maintainability and create a simpler, cleaner, or more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility. Wikipedia, “Code refactoring” Refactoring is a crucial part of the software development process. First, we write messy, clunky, repetitive, but easy to understand and most importantly functional code; then, only after having wrapped our heads around the problem by solving it, we sit back and take a moment to think about whether there might be a more readable or less complex or more performant solution. However, once we have a working solution, it’s often very tempting to just leave it alone; why mess with a good thing and risk introducing bugs? Especially if you’re dealing with a large, old, complicated system that you didn’t build entirely yourself; it can be irresponsible to refactor willy nilly if you don’t fully understand what you’re changing (see Chesterton’s fence). And yet, we do need to make changes to our codebase over time; even if we’re satisfied to never refactor, we at some point have to add new features or make security patches. How do we make sure we don’t inadvertently break anything or introduce bugs? No matter how good our quality assurance team is, it’s not realistic to expect them to manually examine every user path through the app and verify that it still works, with every combination of possible inputs, every single time any developer makes any change. The answer: automated tests. This is why developers invest so much time and effort in writing automated test suites (this is what you’ve been running every time you do a rails grade). Automated tests are nothing more than a separate Ruby script that, essentially, web scrapes our own app, clicks every link, fills out every form, with every possible combination of inputs, and makes sure that the app is doing the right thing under all scenarios. As you might imagine, this self-web-scraping script takes a long time to write; often, longer than a feature itself. But, if you plan to maintain a codebase over the long term (not always true for e.g. a throwaway prototype), it is well worth the investment.

And now I hope you’re staring to notice these and understand them a little bit better. For example the refactoring Fortune Teller chapter: https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/841 You’ve got a path /chapters/841 with two segments, chapters and 841, just like in our dice rolls from refactoring: https://refactoring-fortune-teller.matchthetarget.com/roll/42/1337. We know how to connect a visit to the full path to a Ruby method that can generate dynamic content rather than just having static pages in the public/ folder. After your experience refactoring, you now also know that you can have parts of the path that are dynamic. So we don’t need to write a route for every single URL that we want to support. We can allow pieces of the path to be wildcards (like 841 in our chapter example), and in doing so we can support an infinite number of URLs because anything that matches a certain pattern will be recognized and routed to a single action that knows how to handle all requests of that variety. So this is a second form of user input. The first form was query stings in the URL, and these are the dynamic route segments, which is how users tell us which resource they want. And that’s it for user input! Both of them end up in our params hash, which we can .fetch() from. 19.1.1 Text Companion: URLs and Dynamic Routes "],["video-segment-exchange-rate-api-intro.html", "19.2 Video Segment: Exchange Rate API Intro", " 19.2 Video Segment: Exchange Rate API Intro Notes: time stamp 00:02:10 to 00:03:56 explore https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols discuss JSON format using /symbols and /convert In this next project, let’s finally use some more realistic data. Enough with random numbers and rock, paper, scissors. Let’s get some actual data from APIs like we did with the umbrella project. BENP: did they do this project? The first API that we’re going to use is called https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols. It gives us back JSON that looks like this: // 20221219122429 // https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols { &quot;motd&quot;: { &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;If you or your company use this project or like what we doing, please consider backing us so we can continue maintaining and evolving this project.&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://exchangerate.host/#/donate&quot; }, &quot;success&quot;: true, &quot;symbols&quot;: { &quot;AED&quot;: { &quot;description&quot;: &quot;United Arab Emirates Dirham&quot;, &quot;code&quot;: &quot;AED&quot; }, &quot;AFN&quot;: { &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Afghan Afghani&quot;, &quot;code&quot;: &quot;AFN&quot; }, // ... Where we can see many currencies (even crypto!). This is a free API. If you put in any of their supported symbols, it will instantaneously and for free give you back the current exchange rate. For example if we use the URL to go from USD to Euros: https://api.exchangerate.host/convert?from=USD&amp;to=EUR Then we get back: // 20221219123153 // https://api.exchangerate.host/convert?from=USD&amp;to=EUR { &quot;motd&quot;: { &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;If you or your company use this project or like what we doing, please consider backing us so we can continue maintaining and evolving this project.&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://exchangerate.host/#/donate&quot; }, &quot;success&quot;: true, &quot;query&quot;: { &quot;from&quot;: &quot;USD&quot;, &quot;to&quot;: &quot;EUR&quot;, &quot;amount&quot;: 1 }, &quot;info&quot;: { &quot;rate&quot;: 0.942959 }, &quot;historical&quot;: false, &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2022-12-19&quot;, &quot;result&quot;: 0.942959 } This is great for us to practice our dynamic routes and APIs. We’ll use the two api.exchangerate.host endpoints for listing symbols /symbols and converting currencies /convert to build our target.

This URL should list all of the available symbols, and if I click on one of the links it should take me to a page with the path: /forex/EUR, where the second segment is the currency I clicked. And on that page it should give me all of the symbols, including the current symbol itself. Clicking on a given link there (like “Convert 1 EUR to USD…”), will take me to the URL: /forex/EUR/USD, where I will see the conversion rate. Of course I could type in manually, like: /forex/EUR/MWK if I know the what these URLs look like and how what symbol corresponds to what currency. So you’re job is to build all of that. It should be doable with what you know about dynamic route segments and reading APIs BENP link to dynamic route and reading API content. If you feel up to the challenge, pause the video now and try to build the routes yourself! BENP: suggested pause point at 00:06:00 I’m going to do my usual thing. Start up GitPod, start the server, type in the URL I want to build as a user in the browser, and just start debugging the error messages. Let’s visit config/routes.rb, and we will see it is a completely blank Rails app that we are dealing with. We will start by building /forex. So let’s add the route: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/forex&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;currencies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;first_currency&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“5”} From now on, we are not putting our actions in ApplicationController, so I made up a name called \"currencies\" for the controller and an action within that called \"first_currency\" (because this action will list the first currency in the exchange rate calculation). (As usual, between every step I refresh my browser /forex path, and RTEM.) So now in app/controllers/, I can make a new controller file called currencies_controller.rb, and fill that in with my inheritence from ApplicationController and my action: # app/controllers/currencies_controller.rb class CurrenciesController &lt; ApplicationController def first_currency render({ :template =&gt; &quot;currency_templates/step_one.html.erb&quot; }) end end We made up names for our view templates folder (\"currency_templates/\") and file (\"step_one.html.erb\"), so we need to create both of these in app/views/, and fill in some dummy copy: &lt;!-- app/views/currency_templates/step_one.html.erb --&gt; hi Now everything should be wired up correctly and we can think about the actual work to be done. It can be helpful to start by just mocking up the document with some static HTML to form an outline. We can right-click and “View Source” on the target to help us with the proper HTML tags. We can just copy-paste in the first lines of the body in this case and clean it up a bit. &lt;!-- app/views/currency_templates/step_one.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Currency pairs&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;back&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/forex/AED&quot;&gt; Convert 1 AED to... &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; {: mark_lines=“3-13”} So now we have a starting point. What we need is to get a list of all the symbols like AED above from the API, and print them out in an unordered list of links. We don’t want to hard code the list, we want to get it fresh everytime in case the list of symbols (currencies) changes. From our API endpoint https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols, we just need the currency symbols from the JSON. It might be nice to show the currency name (description): ... - AED: { description: &quot;United Arab Emirates Dirham&quot;, code: &quot;AED&quot; } ... but the target doesn’t do that, so we really just need the keys from the sub-hash. Let’s return to our view template and write in some pseudo-code for what we wish that we had: &lt;!-- app/views/currency_templates/step_one.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Currency pairs&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;back&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;% @array_of_symbols.each do |a_symbol| &gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/forex/AED&quot;&gt; Convert 1 AED to... &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; {: mark_lines=“8 14”} If we had an @array_of_symbols containing all of our currency symbols, we could loop over it with .each, take each a_symbol variable, and replace AED with that symbol, thus building up a long unordered list. Okay, we need to create our desired instance variable in the controller action now: # app/controllers/currencies_controller.rb class CurrenciesController &lt; ApplicationController def first_currency @raw_data = open(&quot;https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols&quot;).read render({ :template =&gt; &quot;currency_templates/step_one.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“6”} We need the URL that has the data (https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols), then we need to use the method open() on that string, and finally we need to call the read method on the opened file, which will return the file as a long string. (Normally, we would need a line require \"open-uri\" to allow Ruby to read files across the internet, but we don’t have to do that in Rails, because Rails has already done that for its own operation.) Once we have the file opened as a string with read in the @raw_data variable, we can convert it to a hash using JSON.parse(): # app/controllers/currencies_controller.rb class CurrenciesController &lt; ApplicationController def first_currency @raw_data = open(&quot;https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols&quot;).read @parsed_data = JSON.parse(@raw_data) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;currency_templates/step_one.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“7”} Now if we view the @parsed_data in our view template (by adding &lt;%= @parsed_data %&gt;), we will see our full hash. And at this point it’s just a matter of peeling off each layer of the onion, and burying into the hash to pull out the symbols: # app/controllers/currencies_controller.rb class CurrenciesController &lt; ApplicationController def first_currency @raw_data = open(&quot;https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols&quot;).read @parsed_data = JSON.parse(@raw_data) @symbols_hash = @parsed_data.fetch(&quot;symbols&quot;) @array_of_symbols = @symbols.keys render({ :template =&gt; &quot;currency_templates/step_one.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“8-9”} We used the handy .keys method on our sub-hash (that we .fetch()ed from the full hash), because the list of symbols is actually contained in the key names. No need to use a second .fetch() in this case. Now we should be good to go in our template, by replacing the AED (in the copy and href link!) with our embedded Ruby tags for each symbol in the array: &lt;!-- app/views/currency_templates/step_one.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Currency pairs&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;back&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;% @array_of_symbols.each do |a_symbol| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/forex/&lt;%= a_symbol %&gt;&quot;&gt; Convert 1 &lt;%= a_symbol %&gt; to... &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; {: mark_lines=“10-11”} In the above, we included embedded Ruby in our HTML tag attribute (href=\"\"). This is very common! We often need to include dynamic responses in the attributes to HTML to get our pages to behave correctly. And now the page /forex should behave like the target. Time for a rails grade and /git commit. Try to tackle the next route /forex/SYMBOL, and maybe even /forex/SYMBOL/SYMBOL, on your own. How can you build a dynamic route to support every possibility here, so you don’t need to hard-code hundreds of individual routes? 19.3.1 Text Companion: Building /forex "],["video-segment-building-forexsymbolsymbol.html", "19.4 Video Segment: Building /forex/SYMBOL/SYMBOL", " 19.4 Video Segment: Building /forex/SYMBOL/SYMBOL Notes: time stamp 00:22:39 to 00:33:01 RCAV /forex/SYMBOL/SYMBOL URL with dynamic route segments that lists all available currency exchange rates from JSON at https://api.exchangerate.host/convert with query strings like ?from=USD&amp;to=EUR Let’s start with the next step, where a user can select a currrency on /forex, which brings them to /forex/SYMBOL, where they can select a second currency bringing them to the exchange rate on /forex/SYMBOL/SYMBOL. We begin by simulating what we want to work by navigating our browser to /forex/AWG, RTEM, and starting the RCAV: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/forex&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;currencies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;first_currency&quot; }) get(&quot;/forex/...&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;currencies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;second_currency&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“7”} Where we have /... above, we want a dynamic route wildcard that can be pulled out in the params, otherwise, we have the usual controller (same as our previous) and a new action we will make in that controller (\"second_currency\"). We don’t want to type /AWG, because that is just one of our many currencies. But, if we remember our dynamic routes BENP: link to dice here, we know we can use a symbol to make it flexible, like so: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/forex&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;currencies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;first_currency&quot; }) get(&quot;/forex/:from_currency&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;currencies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;second_currency&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“7”} Now our routing error in the browser should be gone and we can move on to making the action in our controller: # app/controllers/currencies_controller.rb class CurrenciesController &lt; ApplicationController def first_currency @raw_data = open(&quot;https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols&quot;).read @parsed_data = JSON.parse(@raw_data) @symbols_hash = @parsed_data.fetch(&quot;symbols&quot;) @array_of_symbols = @symbols.keys render({ :template =&gt; &quot;currency_templates/step_one.html.erb&quot; }) end def second_currency render({ :template =&gt; &quot;currency_templates/step_two.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“14-17”} And we will right away add some static markup from the target (“View Source”) into our view template: &lt;!-- app/views/currency_templates/step_two.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Convert AWG&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href=&quot;/forex&quot;&gt;back&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/forex/AWG/INR&quot;&gt; Convert 1 AWG to INR... &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/AWG/EUR&quot;&gt; Convert 1 AWG to EUR... &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; This pattern of list items would need to be repeated over and over. So let’s make the static mockup dynamic by looping over the symbols array: &lt;!-- app/views/currency_templates/step_two.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Convert AWG&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href=&quot;/forex&quot;&gt;back&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;% @array_of_symbols.each do |a_symbol| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/forex/AWG/&lt;%= a_symbol %&gt;&quot;&gt; Convert 1 AWG to &lt;%= a_symbol %&gt;... &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; {: mark_lines=“8-14”} And now back into our controller, just copy and pasting from our previous action: # app/controllers/currencies_controller.rb class CurrenciesController &lt; ApplicationController def first_currency @raw_data = open(&quot;https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols&quot;).read @parsed_data = JSON.parse(@raw_data) @symbols_hash = @parsed_data.fetch(&quot;symbols&quot;) @array_of_symbols = @symbols.keys render({ :template =&gt; &quot;currency_templates/step_one.html.erb&quot; }) end def second_currency @raw_data = open(&quot;https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols&quot;).read @parsed_data = JSON.parse(@raw_data) @symbols_hash = @parsed_data.fetch(&quot;symbols&quot;) @array_of_symbols = @symbols.keys render({ :template =&gt; &quot;currency_templates/step_two.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“16-19”} Okay, it looks close. But we need to get the information out of our dynamic route /forex/SYMBOL to make our page change with each currency. Well everytime we visit a given route (by typing or clicking a link) like /forex/AWG, or /forex/INR, or /forex/EUR, because I defined my route dynamically in config/routes.rb as \"/forex/:from_currency\", if we view our server log in the GitPod terminal window when we visit the page, then we will see: Parameters: {&quot;from_currency&quot;=&gt;&quot;EUR&quot;} So we have the currency symbol in the hash, and we can pull it out and use it in our controller: # app/controllers/currencies_controller.rb class CurrenciesController &lt; ApplicationController def first_currency @raw_data = open(&quot;https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols&quot;).read @parsed_data = JSON.parse(@raw_data) @symbols_hash = @parsed_data.fetch(&quot;symbols&quot;) @array_of_symbols = @symbols.keys render({ :template =&gt; &quot;currency_templates/step_one.html.erb&quot; }) end def second_currency @raw_data = open(&quot;https://api.exchangerate.host/symbols&quot;).read @parsed_data = JSON.parse(@raw_data) @symbols_hash = @parsed_data.fetch(&quot;symbols&quot;) @array_of_symbols = @symbols.keys # params are # Parameters: {&quot;from_currency&quot;=&gt;&quot;EUR&quot;} @from_symbol = params.fetch(&quot;from_currency&quot;) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;currency_templates/step_two.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“16-19”} And back on our template we embed the new instance variable in our previous AWG static mockup (it’s as easy as replacing every instance with &lt;%= @from_symbol %&gt;): &lt;!-- app/views/currency_templates/step_two.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Convert &lt;%= @from_symbol %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href=&quot;/forex&quot;&gt;back&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;% @array_of_symbols.each do |a_symbol| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/forex/&lt;%= @from_symbol %&gt;/&lt;%= a_symbol %&gt;&quot;&gt; Convert 1 &lt;%= @from_symbol %&gt; to &lt;%= a_symbol %&gt;... &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; {: mark_lines=“3 10-11”} And we have a dynamic route setup for the list of currency conversions! Test it manually, do a rails grade, and be sure to /git commit if everything looks good. The last step is to build the second currency symbol route, like /forex/AWG/USD. So you need to get two pieces of data out. You need to write a route that can accept two dynamic segments, fetch both of those segments from the params hash, and then use that to call the API: https://api.exchangerate.host/convert?from=AWG&amp;to=EUR, and finally extract the exchange rate from the JSON returned. 19.4.1 Text Companion: Building /forex/SYMBOL/SYMBOL "],["finish-and-submit-dashboards.html", "19.5 Finish and Submit Dashboards", " 19.5 Finish and Submit Dashboards Notes: covid tracking text at bottom of dashboards.md (from README) 19.5.1 The COVID Tracking Project API endpoint for a single state (Illinois): https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/ca/current.json Full documentation "],["classroom-domain-modeling.html", "20 Classroom Domain Modeling", " 20 Classroom Domain Modeling Notes: This was largely a Day 5 recording classroom exercise and is partially written up in day-5-domain-modeling.md Each ERD and Ideas Slides section could be a separate sub-section: 01-09: review MSM tables 10-11: Yap model 12-15: Photogram model 16-17: Very Best model 18: entity relationship diagrams 19-23: model Booth Ride Share, MyFitness, Chew, Mock Interviewer "],["review-msm-tables.html", "20.1 Review MSM Tables", " 20.1 Review MSM Tables "],["yap-model.html", "20.2 Yap Model", " 20.2 Yap Model "],["photogram-model.html", "20.3 Photogram Model", " 20.3 Photogram Model "],["very-best-model.html", "20.4 Very Best Model", " 20.4 Very Best Model "],["erds.html", "20.5 ERDs", " 20.5 ERDs "],["additional-models.html", "20.6 Additional Models", " 20.6 Additional Models slides 19-23: model Booth Ride Share, MyFitness, Chew, Mock Interviewer "],["omnicalc-debug.html", "21 Omnicalc Debug", " 21 Omnicalc Debug Notes: Optional un-graded assignment, but there are tests built in Project (ungraded): https://github.com/appdev-projects/omnicalc-debug Useful chapters: refactoring-fortune-teller-with-dynamic-routes.md README text at https://github.com/appdev-projects/omnicalc-debug#readme Reading: Rubber Duck Debugging "],["omnicalc-debug-readme.html", "21.1 Omnicalc Debug README", " 21.1 Omnicalc Debug README Here is your target The starting point of this app has four different forms which take input from users, some of which run through the Google Maps API and the DarkSky API, be sure to update your enviroment credientals.

Assuming that we have a database and a table called “contacts” in it (we’ll discuss how to do that in a moment), we would normally have to write Structured Query Language to interact with it. Instead, we can define a class, e.g. Contact, and inherit{:target=\"_blank\"} from ApplicationRecord: class Contact &lt; ApplicationRecord end Then boom — our class Contact has now inherited30 a tremendous number of powerful methods to interact with the contacts table, most of them related to Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting records. We refer to these database-related classes as models, and we place them in the app/models folder within our Rails app. These classes talk to the database for us, contain most of our business logic, and are, in many ways, the heart of our applications. Actually, these methods mostly come from our grandparent class ActiveRecord::Base rather than our immediate parent class ApplicationRecord. We’ll go into these details later.↩︎ "],["the-quick-way-to-create-a-table.html", "23.1 The quick way to create a table", " 23.1 The quick way to create a table Suppose we wanted to build an app called Rolodex that helps us keep track of our contacts. For this app, we need a table (let’s call it “contacts”) with three columns: first name, last name, and date of birth. In Rails, anything that can be automated, is automated. Much like we used the rails new command to generated dozens of folders and hundreds of files of boilerplate code, we can use another command to generate the boilerplate code that goes into creating a database table. Here is what the command looks like: rails generate draft:model contact first_name:string last_name:string date_of_birth:date All of the generators, of which there are many, are invoked by starting with rails generate. We select which generator we want with the third part: in this case, draft:model. “Model” is the word we use to refer to the Ruby classes that represent our database tables, because we use those tables to model the entities in our problem domains. The fourth part is the name we want for the class/table; singular (the Ruby class name will be singular, as we’ve seen with e.g. Person, even though we usually think about table names as plural). After that, we provide a list of the columns we want in the table, along with each column’s datatype. We need to run this command at a command prompt. The Terminal window that is running the web server is stuck in an infinite loop of listening for web requests, so we can’t run any commands in there. Open another Terminal window (from the Terminal menu, select New), paste in the command above at the $ prompt, and press return. You’ll see some output in the Terminal that looks something like this: invoke active_record create db/migrate/20190422125330_create_contacts.rb create app/models/contact.rb Next, run this command: rails db:migrate You’d see some output in the Terminal that looks something like this: == 20190422125330 CreateContacts: migrating =================================== -- create_table(:contacts) -&gt; 0.0037s == 20190422125330 CreateContacts: migrated (0.0037s) ========================== That’s it — with these two commands, you now have a fully-formed database table and a Ruby class that will help us easily interact with it. We could just as easily add another table to our database — maybe a table called “companies” with columns “name”, “industry”, and a few others. Run these two commands: rails generate draft:model company name:string industry:string structure:string last_year_revenue:integer founded_on:date rails db:migrate Voilá — now we have two tables, and are ready to CRUD rows in them. "],["time-to-crud.html", "23.2 Time to CRUD", " 23.2 Time to CRUD 23.2.1 Command prompt vs rails console Let’s learn the methods we’ve inherited from ActiveRecord to make it easy. To do so, open a new Terminal and run the command rails console (or rails c for short). This will change the prompt from $ to [1] pry(main)&gt; The former is the command prompt and the latter is the rails console. It’s important to always know which one you are in. rails console is an interactive way to try out Ruby with immediate feedback. It’s quicker than writing into a file and then running it. You can only do Ruby in here (like \"hello\".capitalize). You cannot do command prompt things (like cd or ls or rails generate migration...). If you want to get out of rails console and back to the command prompt, which is like quitting an app to get back to the desktop of your computer, then type exit — or just open a new Terminal window. "],["create.html", "23.3 CREATE", " 23.3 CREATE 23.3.1 new In rails console, try the following: Contact.all You’ll see that we get back an empty array. Right now, we have no rows in our table. We can confirm this with Contact.all.count. We do Contact.all.count so often that Rails lets us take a shortcut — we can just do Contact.count directly. A crucial thing to remember: when you are talking to the whole table, you are referencing the class Contact, so use a capital letter. If you did contact.count, what error message would you expect? Try it and see. Like any Ruby class31 we instantiate a new, blank object with the .new method: c = Contact.new As usual we store the new object in a variable so that we can continue to work with it; in this case, we named the variable c. This object has attribute setter methods for every column in the table: c.first_name = &quot;Raghu&quot; c.last_name = &quot;Betina&quot; We didn’t have to declare the attr_accessors like we did for pure Ruby classes — by inheriting from ApplicationRecord, our Contact class gains superpowers. It connects to the database, figures out what columns are in the “contacts” table, and automatically defines methods to access each column that exists. 23.3.2 save So far, this is just like a pure Ruby class with attr_accessors. But, crucially, we have the .save method now. Try it: c.save Whoa! Some fancy new output. What you see is the actual SQL that is generated in order to transact with the database and save the data permanently to a row. Now you can just type c and it should show you that c has been inserted into the database and it has been assigned an ID number. If you exit rails console, shut down the computer, and come back into rails console tomorrow, and do Contact.count, you will see 1 — the data will still be there (although the variable c will not — try it). We have saved it permanently. Try Contact.all, and you will see that the array of rows is no longer empty! Add a few more contacts: c = Contact.new c.first_name = &quot;Minnie&quot; c.last_name = &quot;Mouse&quot; c.date_of_birth = &quot;November 18, 1928&quot; c.save Contact.count # =&gt; 2 c = Contact.new c.first_name = &quot;Mickey&quot; c.last_name = &quot;Mouse&quot; c.date_of_birth = &quot;May 15, 1928&quot; c.save Contact.count # =&gt; 3 Why does it work to re-use the variable c here? Well, when we .save on the prior one, we’ve entered the record in to the table and it is assigned an ID. Then we throw away the contents of the variable c and replace it with a brand new, blank row with Contact.new — but that’s okay, because the old data is stored on disk and we can always look it up by its ID number if we need it. Remember Array, Hash, or even String, before we got to their literal shorthand syntaxes? We always started with .new, and then built up from scratch.↩︎ "],["read.html", "23.4 READ", " 23.4 READ 23.4.1 all Returns: an array of records To retrieve all of the rows from a table, you can call .all on the class: contact_list = Contact.all The return value of .all is an Array-like object (technically it’s an ActiveRecord::Relation, but we can do all of our usual Array methods on it — .each, etc). Sometimes I may shorten this to Relation, or refer to them as “collections” or “sets” of records. 23.4.2 count Returns: an Integer We’ve already met .count, which tells you how many records are in a collection: Contact.all.count 23.4.3 first Returns: a single record c = Contact.all.first 23.4.4 last Returns: a single record Returns the last record in a collection. c = Contact.all.last 23.4.5 Attribute accessor methods However you got it, once you have an individual row stored in a variable, let’s call it c, then you have a method for each column to retrieve the value for that cell: c = Contact.all.sample c.id c.first_name c.last_name c.date_of_birth c.created_at c.updated_at What is the return value if you try calling a method for a column that doesn’t exist? c.middle_name RTEM! You’re going to see it a lot. 23.4.6 order Returns: an array of records The .order method lets you sort your collections by one or more columns. The argument to .order is a Hash, where the key is the column you want to sort by, and the value is either :asc (for ascending order) or :desc (for descending order): Contact.all.order({ :last_name =&gt; :asc }) If you send .order a Symbol alone, outside of a Hash, then ascending order is assumed: Contact.all.order(:last_name) To break ties, you can provide multiple columns in the Hash: Contact.all.order({ :last_name =&gt; :asc, :first_name =&gt; :asc, :date_of_birth =&gt; :desc }) This would first order by last name, then break ties using first name, then break ties using date of birth. 23.4.7 reverse Returns: an array of records .reverse reverses the ordering of a collection. Not particularly common, since you can use :asc and :desc to specify the direction you want explicitly, but there it is: Contact.order(:first_name).reverse 23.4.8 where Returns: an array of records Perhaps the most important READ method is .where. This is our bread-and-butter tool for filtering a collection of rows down using various criteria. The argument to .where is a Hash, where the key is the column you want to filter by, and the value is the criteria you want to filter by: Contact.all.where({ :id =&gt; 2 }) A bit of syntactic sugar — to save us some typing, we can call .where directly on the class if we want to, rather than calling .all first: Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; &quot;Mouse&quot; }) You can provide multiple columns to filter by in the Hash: Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; &quot;Mouse&quot;, :first_name =&gt; &quot;Minnie&quot; }) 23.4.9 where always returns a collection, not a single row The return value from .where is always a collection, regardless of how many results there are. Whether there are 0, 1, or a million results, you still have an array. What would you expect if you tried the following? Contact.where({ :id =&gt; 2 }).first_name Try it. RTEM! So, use .at(0) (a.k.a .first) or .at(-1) (a.k.a. .last) or some other method to retrieve an element from the array if you want to do something with an individual record: c = Contact.where({ :id =&gt; 2 }).at(0) c.first_name 23.4.10 Using where with an array of criteria Returns: an array of records You can even use an Array in the argument to .where; it will then bring back the rows that match any of the criteria for that column: Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; [&quot;Betina&quot;, &quot;Woods&quot;] }) 23.4.11 Chaining wheres Returns: an array of records Since .where returns another collection, you can chain .wheres one after the other: Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; &quot;Mouse&quot; }).where({ :first_name =&gt; &quot;Minnie&quot; }) This narrows the search. 23.4.12 where(this).or(that) Returns: an array of records You can broaden the search with .or: Contact.where({ :first_name =&gt; &quot;Mickey&quot; }).or(Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; &quot;Betina&quot; })) This may look a little funny. We tack .or onto the end of one collection, and the argument to .or is an entire query, starting from the class again. The return value is both collections merged together. 23.4.13 where.not(this) Returns: an array of records You can negate a criteria with .not: Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; &quot;Mouse&quot; }).where.not({ :first_name =&gt; &quot;Mickey&quot; }) You tack where.not on to a collection and it accepts all the same arguments as .where, but the result set is all of the records in the original collection except the ones that match the criteria. 23.4.14 Where is everything Everything from looking up a movie’s director to putting together a feed in a social network ultimately boils down to .wheres and .eachs. I can’t emphasize the importance of .where enough. Ask lots of questions. 23.4.15 map_relation_to_array Returns: a regular Ruby array of scalar values (not records, and not an individual value) Once you’ve retrieved the right subset of records, you can peel off the values in just one column with .map_relation_to_array: Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; &quot;Mouse&quot; }).map_relation_to_array(:first_name) # =&gt; [&quot;Minnie&quot;, &quot;Mickey&quot;] The .map_relation_to_array method returns an Array of values. This can be handy in conjunction with the ability to pass .where an Array of criteria to filter by, e.g.: shawshank_id = 4 shawshank_roles = Role.where({ :movie_id =&gt; shawshank_id }) cast_ids = shawshank_roles.map_relation_to_array(:actor_id) # =&gt; [12, 94, 34] shawshank_actors = Actor.where({ :id =&gt; cast_ids }) # =&gt; the collection of Shawshank&#39;s actors Returns an Array of values in the column. Not a single value, even if there was only one record in the ActiveRecord_Relation. Not an ActiveRecord_Relation, so you can no longer use methods like .where, .order, etc. You can use Array methods like .each, .at, etc. The argument to .map_relation_to_array must be a Symbol that matches the name of a column in the table. You cannot call .map_relation_to_array on an individual ActiveRecord row. If you want the value in a column for an individual row, simply call the accessor method directly: # for an array of records people.last_name # undefined method for array; bad people.map_relation_to_array(:last_name) # =&gt; [&quot;Betina&quot;, &quot;Woods&quot;]; good # for an individual record person.last_name # =&gt; &quot;Woods&quot;; good person.map_relation_to_array(:last_name) # undefined method for Person; bad 23.4.16 distinct It is sometimes possible to retrieve a collection of records that contains duplicates, which we may not want (because it will e.g. throw off our count). To remove duplicates, you can use the .distinct method: # Imagine Eddie&#39;s ID is 42 in the actors table: eddies_roles = Role.where({ :actor_id =&gt; 42 }) # But what if Eddie played multiple roles in the same film? eddies_movie_ids = eddies_roles.map_relation_to_array(:movie_id) # =&gt; [1, 3, 3, 12, 19] This array now has duplicate IDs in it. # If we use it to do a lookup of movies, we&#39;ll get duplicate rows: bad_eddies_movies = Movie.where({ :id =&gt; eddies_movie_ids }) # We can use .distinct to solve the problem: good_eddies_movies = Movie.where({ :id =&gt; eddies_movie_ids }).distinct "],["update.html", "23.5 UPDATE", " 23.5 UPDATE To update a row, first you need to locate it: c = Contact.where({ :id =&gt; 2 }).first And then assign whatever new values you want to: c.first_name = &quot;Minerva&quot; And then don’t forget to save the changes: c.save That’s it.

The % characters are wildcards, which match anything in that position. So that query would find all rows that have the fragment “bet” anywhere within the last_name column. 23.7.2 Less than or greater than You can search for rows less than or greater than certain criteria: Contact.where(&quot;date_of_birth &gt; ?&quot;, 30.years.ago) Contact.where(&quot;last_name &gt;= ? AND last_name &lt;= ?&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;) Notice that you can have multiple placeholders ? in the SQL fragment, and the subsequent arguments will be plugged in in order. That last query, for a value within a range, can also be written with a Hash and a Range: Instructor.where({ :last_name =&gt; (&quot;A&quot;..&quot;C&quot;) }) This is particularly handy for searching for records within a particular range of times: start_date = 7.days.ago end_date = Date.today Contact.where({ :created_at =&gt; (start_date..end_date) }) With Ruby Ranges, two dots means inclusive of the second value, and three dots means exclusive of the second value.

First and foremost, we can generate new migrations to add new tables and modify existing tables. To modify existing tables, the most common tools we use are add_column and remove_column. Generate a new migration (not a whole model like above) at a Terminal prompt with, for example: rails g migration AddTitleToInstructors or rails g migration RemoveLastNameFromInstructors Try to pick a name for the migration that’s descriptive of the change that you want make, like I did above. Then, go into the new migration file and add instructions to make the change you want within the change method (or the up method, if that’s what you find inside instead of change): def change add_column :instructors, :title, :string end or def change remove_column :instructors, :last_name end Then execute the migration with rails db:migrate at a Terminal prompt. If your database gets into a weird state (usually caused by deleting old migration files), your ultimate last resort is rails db:drop This will destroy your entire database and all the data within it.

Now finally after all this time, we know enough HTML, we know enough Ruby, we know about routing, we know about params, and we’ve been populating our embedded Ruby templates with information from forms (data from our users), and we’ve even gotten information from external APIs and populated our embedded Ruby templates with useful info from someone else’s database. Finally it’s time for us to store the information that users are typing into forms in our own databases and then populate our Ruby templates with information from those database tables. Thus, we come back around on our original goal of building a database backed web application. In other words, we’re going to build Software as a Service. So let’s get started. BENP: Starting our GitPod Workspace, 00:01:45 to 00:01:54 Here is the assignment. As usual: Start the web server by running bin/server. Navigate to your live application preview. As you work, remember to navigate to /git and Always Be Committing. Organize your workspace tabs. BENP: Added this step! Run rails grade as often as you like to see how you are doing, but make sure you test your app manually first to make sure it matches the target’s behavior. BENP: possible image(s) (better, GIFs?) of starting a workspace, opening /git, organizing tabs, noting the target favicon. But these are probably in a different chapter. The target for this project is here. If we take a look at the target homepage at the path /, we will see the familiar movies, directors, and actors database content that we have been diagramming. We will build a simple web application that displays this data in a very straightforward manner. There’s a list of all directors and a details page for each director. About as simple as you can imagine for our first contact with a database driven web application. We also have a page that shows just the youngest director (/directors/youngest) and just the eldest (/directors/eldest). This will give us practice on how to narrow and query our data for just specific pieces of information. If we were to go and delete the eldest director by clicking on their name and then the “delete” link, and then come back and look at /directors/eldest, the page would change. So this is a live page, not just static HTML. Also if I have /movies, and similarly /actors, what’s important on a given movie page, I have the name of the director. That’s not just a string in the movie table. If I were to edit that director’s name, that would update on the movie page. So that is a foreign key being stored and we are connecting up these entities using their keys and then doing lookups to populate the pages. Finally, if I go to the details page of a given director, at the bottom there is a “Filmography” with all the films that that person has directed. This is also being drawn dynamically. It doesn’t look like much, but our target has all of the elements of IMDB. It isn’t styled well, but we could throw some bootstrap in and make it look nice. Right now there are one-to-many and many-to-many connections, and if we throw some cookies in here for authentification sign-in and sign-out, then we would have a full application. Moving away from the target, let’s get going now in our Rails app on GitPod. We have a lot of work to do in our application. 24.1.1 Text Companion: Recordkeeping Review, Exploring the Target "],["video-segment-exploring-railsdb.html", "24.2 Video Segment: Exploring /rails/db", " 24.2 Video Segment: Exploring /rails/db -Notes: time stamp 00:04:30 to 00:08:21 clicking around in /rails/db looking at tables development database SQLite How do we create a database table? How do we put data into the table? How do we get it back out? How do we get that data into controller action? How do we get it into a view template? Here’s a couple things that are going to make our job easier, the README and a chapter active-record.md. BENP: these two items need to be zipped in to this doc There’s also a couple of tools included in this (and every other) GitPod Rails project: http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rails/info: shows all visitable routes in the applications http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rails/db: shows a visual interface for the database These are kind of like /git, which we’ve already used. They are URL paths that are only available in development mode for our apps, but once the app is deployed to users in production mode, they won’t be visible. If we open our app browser, we can see that we do have a homepage / with the links for directors, movies, etc., but if we try any of the links, then we get a “no route matches” error. Before we do anything, navigate to /rails/db in the browser. You will see a really cool gem. This is not included in Rails by default, it’s rather a third party gem from the community. It’s a visual interface to your database: Rails includes a database out-of-the-box. This is unlike other frameworks, where you need to pick one, connect to it, etc. If you’re lucky you can easily connect to it, but you still have to set it up. Rails includes a development database called SQLite (often pronounced as Sequel Light). /rails/db gives you a visual way of looking at your database. You can see on the left the four tables that I’ve already created for this project: actors, characters, directors, and movies BENP: here and elsewhere below I put table names in code font, and added the columns we are familiar with. If you click on actors, you will be brought to the URL /rails/db/tables/actors/data, and you will see a blank table with columns Name, Dob, Bio, Image, Created at, and Updated at. These were already put together for you. In the next project you will create your own tables. Creating your own tables is also covered in the active-record.md chapter. BENP: probably zip this part of the chapter into the next project when it is actually relevant. At 00:07:51 in this video, there is a teaser of the commands, but this should be left out at this point. 24.2.1 Text Companion: Exploring /rails/db "],["video-segment-sql-and-activerecord-intro.html", "24.3 Video Segment: SQL and ActiveRecord Intro", " 24.3 Video Segment: SQL and ActiveRecord Intro -Notes: time stamp 00:08:21 to 00:12:03 adding a record with SQL command in directors table at /rails/db/sql in the SQL Editor Ruby to performant SQL with ActiveRecord object relational mapper database transactions Another cool thing about /rails/db, is that, if you happen to know Structured Query Language (SQL), then you can click “SQL Editor”, which will bring you to /rails/db/sql, where you can actually execute SQL commands. SQL (often pronounced as Sequel BENP: is that right?), is the actual language that relational databases use. For example, an BENP: an or a, depends on pronounciation SQL statement for adding a director to the directors table looks like: INSERT INTO &quot;directors&quot; (&quot;name&quot;, &quot;dob&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;created_at&quot;, &quot;updated_at&quot;) VALUES (&quot;Greta Gerwig&quot;, &quot;1983-08-04&quot;, &quot;Greta Celeste Gerwig /ˈɡɜːrwɪɡ/; born August 4, 1983) is an American actress and filmmaker. She first garnered attention after working on and appearing in several mumblecore films. Between 2006 and 2009, she appeared in a number of films by Joe Swanberg, some of which she co-wrote or co-directed, including Hannah Takes the Stairs 2007) and Nights and Weekends 2008).&quot;, &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Greta_Gerwig_Berlinale_2018.jpg/330px-Greta_Gerwig_Berlinale_2018.jpg&quot;, &quot;2020-05-19 17:47:04.103354&quot;, &quot;2020-05-19 17:47:04.103354&quot;) SQL is a create language, though it is hard to just type out by hand. But it is very powerful. For application development, you don’t really need to do it by hand anymore. I haven’t actually written raw SQL for quite some time now. The Ruby library we use called ActiveRecord basically translates Ruby into such good SQL that it’s probably better than what you would write by hand. If you are doing very advanced data analysis and generating reports, then you probably want to learn SQL. If we copy, past, and “execute” (click the button) those two lines of SQL code in our “SQL Editor” on /rails/db/sql, then navigate to our directors table by clicking the link on the left side of the browser, we will see a new row (a new record) has been added to our previously empty table. So the SQL statement issued a transaction with the database! Now this data is saved forever in my actual database on my server, which is in some sense a much more secure and safe storage space than storing cookies on my users’ browser. You only get a tiny amount of storage space for cookies and the users can clear this whenever they want. Cookies are useful for uniquely identifying users (and is the only way to do that), so they are important for certain things. But for actually storing information for the long run, you need to store it yourself in a database (storage space) that you control. BENP: this cookies aside can be dropped I think Fundamentally all we do to store data is issue SQL statements to the database. Now, we don’t have time to learn SQL, and we really wouldn’t want to anyway. We’re just going to use the amazing Ruby library included with Rails called ActiveRecord. This allows us to just think in terms of Ruby, and classes, and instances, and just do the Ruby that we are used to (we don’t need to run the below anywhere, this was already done in our SQL prompt above): d = Director.new d.name = &quot;Greta Gerwig&quot; d.dob = &quot;August 4, 1983&quot; d.bio = &quot;Greta Celeste Gerwig /ˈɡɜːrwɪɡ/; born August 4, 1983) is an American actress and filmmaker. She first garnered attention after working on and appearing in several mumblecore films. Between 2006 and 2009, she appeared in a number of films by Joe Swanberg, some of which she co-wrote or co-directed, including Hannah Takes the Stairs 2007) and Nights and Weekends 2008).&quot; d.image = &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Greta_Gerwig_Berlinale_2018.jpg/330px-Greta_Gerwig_Berlinale_2018.jpg&quot; d.save Here, we use .new to create a new class variable instance (a new row in our directors table), and then we use the attribute accessors .name, .dob, .bio, and .image to assign values to that instance. Finally, we call a method .save to put together and issue the SQL statement that will actually add the row (record) to our database table. So ActiveRecord, called an object relational mapper, is a perfect, elegant mapping between the Ruby that we are comfortable with and performant SQL. 24.3.1 Text Companion: SQL and ActiveRecord Intro "],["video-segment-creating-appmodels-classes.html", "24.4 Video Segment: Creating app/models/ Classes", " 24.4 Video Segment: Creating app/models/ Classes -Notes: time stamp 00:12:03 to 00:14:35 just showing off app/models/ files for the four tables that we would like to have not actually creating these yet review our-own-classes.md inheritance from ApplicationRecord Okay, so let’s do this. First we’ll go back to our Rails application and create Ruby classes for the four tables in our database. We need to create four files, each containing a new class in the GitPod folder app/models/: # app/models/actor.rb class Actor &lt; ApplicationRecord end # app/models/character.rb class Character &lt; ApplicationRecord end # app/models/director.rb class Director &lt; ApplicationRecord end # app/models/movie.rb class Movie &lt; ApplicationRecord end Each filename is the table (singular), and it contains the same (but capitalized) classname. For instance, the table actors has a file app/models/actor.rb, containing a class Actor. It’s been a long-time, and if you’re rusty that’s understandable. Now might be a good time to review the idea of defining classes here. BENP: could include a few code blocks from this doc here We haven’t used the app/models/ folder yet, but that’s where all of our database-related Ruby code goes. In some sense, it’s the most important folder to us, as that’s where all of our business logic goes BENP: what is business logic?. Importantly, in the above files, we inherit &lt; from a base class called ApplicationRecord, and that is where we get all of our amazing power. That is a base class provided by Rails, and our classes will inherit methods that translate code to SQL and have insane amounts of power that we will have a lot of time to learn about. 24.4.1 Text Companion: Creating app/models/ Classes "],["video-segment-rcav-directors-and-director-class.html", "24.5 Video Segment: RCAV /directors and Director Class", " 24.5 Video Segment: RCAV /directors and Director Class -Notes: time stamp 00:14:35 to 00:28:12 wire up /directors with RCAV database naming conventions: get(\"/directors\", { :controller =&gt; \"directors\", :action =&gt; \"index\" }), app/models/director.rb, Director class, directors table inheritence in model: Director &lt; ApplicationRecord &lt; ActiveRecord::Base .each to list database info from the one record we added manually via SQL on inherited .all method to Director create app/models/: movies.rb, actors.rb, and characters.rb Before we proceed, as you know there’s no point in writing code or doing anything unless you have a way of seeing what is happening as you go. There’s a bunch of ways we could do this. Let’s pick a page to work on. How about the first page linked in the target, the list of all directors: /directors. So we navigate our app browser to that URL and begin debugging our RCAV. I am also going to keep open the tab /rails/db because it’s a useful visual reference. As usual the first error message is “no route matches”, so connect the dots and make it say hello: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;homepage&quot; }) get(&quot;/directors&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;directors&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“6”} Now that we’re in the world of databases, we are going to stick to some common conventions for naming things. Very quickly you will see that we want one controller per database table (\"directors\"). And then the action where we list the whole database is typically called \"index\". You will almost always have an action that just lists all the records in the table, or at least many records, and that is usually called \"index\". Now to the controller (create the file and fill it in): # app/controllers/directors_controller.rb class DirectorsController &lt; ApplicationController def index render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/index.html.erb&quot; }) end end And we create the view template: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;hi&lt;/h1&gt; If that all works when we refresh our app browser, then we can begin to add some pseudo-code from the target (“View Source” on the page of interest) to our view template: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of all directors&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;%= Director.all %&gt; {: mark_lines=“3-5”} We just want to embed some Ruby code, where we imagine that we have a way to list our entire directors table using a class called Director with a method called .all. That would be cool if we could do something like that, and get all of our directors in an array to put into a table on our HTML page. If we refresh /directors in our app browser, then we get the error “uninitialized constant … Director”, because we haven’t defined our class yet. To define the Director class, if you haven’t already, then create the file director.rb in app/models/ and fill it in: # app/models/director.rb class Director end Now if we refresh /directors, the error message changes to: “undefined method `all’ for Director:Class”. So we do have a Director class (Rails knows to look in app/models/ for it), but no method .all… Well, we can inherit this method! # app/models/director.rb class Director &lt; ApplicationRecord end {: mark_lines=“3”} We don’t need to write the method in here (like def Director.all and all the SQL stuff that would come after that), because we are just going to use the .all method inherited from ApplicationRecord. We can actually look into app/models/ and we would see the file application_record.rb, which looks like: # app/models/application_record.rb class ApplicationRecord &lt; ActiveRecord::Base self.abstract_class = true end We see that this class actually itself inherits from the aforementioned ActiveRecord::Base from inside the Rails gem. Now try to refresh /directors. It works! We should see (assuming we just have the one Greta Gerwig entry that we issued from the SQL editor on /rails/db) something like: “Director::ActiveRecord_Relation (array with 1 Director instance inside)” Think about this! I didn’t need to do anything. I just inherited the .all method. This was able to go to the database, find (out of four tables) the table I wanted to connect to based on the name of the class, and then it issued the SQL to get the records, and then it returned the records to us as this class ActiveRecord_Relation. ActiveRecord_Relation is an important class to memorize the name of. It is not an array, but it is like an array. It has multiple things inside. ActiveRecord_Relation is a term to memorize: it means, “an array full of rows from the database”. We can go to /rails/db and click the link to our directors table, and at the top of the page use the useful “+ ADD” button on the top of the page to manually enter another director record into the database (you can just put your name and some random information for now), and if we refresh the /directors page again, we would see: “Director::ActiveRecord_Relation (array with 2 Director instances inside)” The page is dynamically updating with the .all command reconnecting to the database table everytime I load the page! ActiveRecord_Relation is a funny looking name, but it’s just an array. Which means we can call all the array methods, like: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of all directors&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;%= Director.all.count %&gt; {: mark_lines=“5”} .count to print the number of records on our page. Or, what we want, a .each loop to print our records into a table: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of all directors&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;% Director.all.each do |a_director| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= a_director %&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; {: mark_lines=“5-9”} If we refresh our URL now, we would see that each list item is an instance of the Director class that we defined in app/models/director.rb. And each of these instances have attribute accessors associated with the columns of the table. To start, if we modify the view template to: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of all directors&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;% Director.all.each do |a_director| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= a_director.name %&gt;, &lt;%= a_director.dob %&gt;, &lt;%= a_director.bio %&gt;, &lt;%= a_director.id %&gt;, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; {: mark_lines=“7-10”} Then the name, DOB, bio, and table ID of each director will be printed in a list on our refreshed /directors page. Remember, we still haven’t done anything special in our app/models/director.rb file. But we get our attribute accessors for free from Rails using our inherited functionality. If we tried to change one of our embedded Ruby tags in the view template to &lt;%= a_director.title %&gt;, then we would get the page error: “undefined method ‘title’ for #Director”. That’s because title is an attribute associated with the movies table, and we are pulling records from directors with our Director class. All for free, just by defining our classes. If you haven’t done so, let’s define the other three classes now by creating and filling in those files in app/models/: movies.rb, actors.rb, and characters.rb. 24.5.1 Text Companion: RCAV /directors and Director Class "],["video-segment-rails-console.html", "24.6 Video Segment: Rails Console", " 24.6 Video Segment: Rails Console -Notes: time stamp 00:28:12 to 00:32:16 explore Director in rails console state of terminal (pry(main)&gt; vs $) rails console quirks: pagination, quiting view, exiting Alright, now that we have all four classes in our app/models/ folder we can continue. One thing we may have noted is that it’s a bit cumbersome to play with our models in a view template, where we need to keep going to the app/views/ folder, modifying the template’s embedded Ruby tags, and then refreshing our browser URL to see the results. Let’s look at a better place to do this, the Rails console. We’ve already seen this a bit. Go to GitPod, make sure your terminal window is open (Cmd + J), and open a new terminal (keep the bin/server terminal running so the browser tab doesn’t crash). You can can open a new terminal by going to the top menu “Terminal” and selecting “New Terminal”. Now at this fresh terminal you can enter rails console (or just rails c for short will do the same thing): gitpod /workspace/msm-queries $ rails console BENP: not sure the code block name for terminal, leaving it as ruby blank And what should come up is something like: Running via Spring preloader in process 8739 Loading development environment (Rails 6.0.3.2) [1] pry(main)&gt; This is just like the REPLs that we have already seen and used. We can enter whatever Ruby code interactively one line at a time and see printed out results! Now, at the terminal running rails console, try to enter: pry(main)&gt; Director.all This should give you something like: (0.2ms) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &quot;directors&quot; =&gt; Director::ActiveRecord_Relation (array with 2 Director instances inside) Just like what we saw when experimenting with our view template and the embedded Ruby tag &lt;%= Director.all %&gt;. Keep in mind what state your terminal is in. If you see something like pry(main)&gt; at the terminal prompt, then you know you are not in a regular $-sign terminal prompt and if you try to run rails grade, you will get an “undefined local varialbe or method grade” error. To exit the rails console and get back to a regular terminal, you need to run pry(main)&gt; exit. BENP: Rails Console Quirks, 00:30:05 to 00:32:16 A quick aside with some important notes about rails console: Try to enter: pry(main)&gt; Director.all.at(0) Since Director.all is a type of array, we can use the array method .at(0) to get the first time. Now, what you should see, assuming that first entry is Greta Gerwig and your terminal window is too small to fit the entire bio, is something like: Director Load (0.2ms) SELECT &quot;directors&quot;.* FROM &quot;directors&quot; WHERE &quot;directors&quot;.&quot;name&quot; = ? ORDER BY &quot;directors&quot;.&quot;id&quot; ASC LIMIT ?

She first garnered attention after working on a : Sometimes when the output of a Ruby expression is very long, rails console is going to paginate it for you. You will have a : prompt when this is true, and you can hit return to scroll through line by line, or space to scroll through page by page. When you reach the end of the output, you’ll see (END). To get back to the regular prompt so that you can enter your next command, just hit q at any time. And one last thing: if you are in rails console and then make a change to a model (for example, you define a new method or fix a syntax error), then, annoyingly, you have to exit and then start a new rails console to pick up the new logic. The console is not live-loading with changes we make to our app. Or, you can use the reload! method. BENP: \"reload doesn’t always work in my experience, maybe delete this last sentence 24.6.1 Text Companion: Rails Console "],["video-segment-reading-and-creating-records.html", "24.7 Video Segment: Reading and Creating Records", " 24.7 Video Segment: Reading and Creating Records -Notes: time stamp 00:32:16 to 00:36:35 explore Director in rails console R and C in CRUD reading records with Director.all.at(0) creating records with .new and .save Let’s now explore our tables from the rails console prompt! Our main goal, is that we need to learn the Ruby required to Create, Read, Update, and Delete records. Once we know all the Ruby to CRUD, we can connect that with all the other Ruby we learned, and we’ll be able to create an app. Actually, we already started on the R, to read from our table in the view template.

She first garnered attention after working on a : Press q to get back to the prompt if our output is paginated with the : symbol. But we wanted that second input (a.at(0)) in its own variable. Well we can just press the Up Arrow on our keyboard at the prompt and that will give me back the last run line, then I can jump to the beginning of the line with Cntrl + a, and put it in its own variable: pry(main)&gt; x = a.at(0) pry(main)&gt; x.name =&gt; &quot;Greta Gerwig&quot; So we .all to get the records, .at() to select one of the records, and then .name to get one of the column values, and you have Read a value from the database! There’s a lot more depth for reading that we can go into, but there’s the most basic. BENP: Rails Console Creating Records, 00:34:35 to 00:36:35 Now, let’s move onto Creating records. Let’s create a new actor in our actors database table. This is just like how we created a new Person in our previous exercises. There’s even a reference for how to do it in this case here. Again, in the rails console, enter line-by-line: pry(main)&gt; a = Actor.new ... pry(main)&gt; a.name = &quot;Morgan Freeman&quot; ... pry(main)&gt; a.dob = &quot;June 1, 1937&quot; ... Now, we could fill out every attribute of a, with the exception of created_at, updated_at, and id, as these are automatically filled in by Rails and we don’t want to edit them. But if we just have a look now at the variable: pry(main)&gt; a =&gt; #&lt;Actor:0x0000558c85f492e8 id: nil, name: &quot;Morgan Freeman&quot;, dob: Tue, 01 Jun 1937, bio: nil, image: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil&gt; we see a is just an Actor instance being populated by information we enter. But if we go to our tab with the /rails/db page running and go to our table actors, we don’t see this data there. The reason is, it’s not sure if we’re done populating the columns. So when we are done, we need to call the very important method .save: pry(main)&gt; a.save (0.1ms) begin transaction Actor Create (0.8ms) INSERT INTO &quot;actors&quot; (&quot;name&quot;, &quot;dob&quot;, &quot;created_at&quot;, &quot;updated_at&quot;) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)

It begins a transaction, issues the robust SQL, and enters it in the database! Have a look again at the actors table in /rails/db to see for yourself. And we have now Created records. 24.7.1 Text Companion: Reading and Creating Records "],["video-segment-sample_data.html", "24.8 Video Segment: sample_data", " 24.8 Video Segment: sample_data -Notes: time stamp 00:36:35 to 00:42:10 test data without .save rails sample_data rake task in tasks/dev.rake view /rails/db So far we have just manually entering data. For instance if we try: pry(main)&gt; Movie.count (We can leave off .all on the class itself! It’s a class-level method because it is so commonly done, and you will often see it omitted.) And that will return: =&gt; 0. So, the only thing really missing right now is our big database to play with. It would be a huge pain to manually enter a ton of movies, actors, characters, and directors (not to mention keeping track of the foreign keys!). Try a few yourself and see (don’t forget to .save to update the database with each new entry). But wait, stop! That would take forever. In the real world, someone would initially have to add all of our data, whether it’s us, or our employees, or our users (through forms in their browser, obviously, not through rails console). Luckily for us we don’t need to do any of this manual entering for this project! We have included a handy program that you can run. If you open a fresh terminal on GitPod, get back to your regular $-sign command prompt, and run the command rails sample_data: gitpod /workspace/msm-queries $ rails sample_data There are 34 directors in the database There are 52 movies in the database There are 652 actors in the database There are 724 characters in the database It will run a rake task BENP: might need to define rake task here, that I wrote called sample_data, which you can find in the tasks/dev.rake file. This Ruby script will do the process of adding data to our database and making sure the foreign keys are all correct. You can see the number of records entered in each table. This program will also first delete any previous records we entered, so we can start with a fresh dataset from scratch. If you refresh /rails/db, then you will see all of these data in our tables. Also, if you go back to the /directors page that we were working on, you will see many entries now being listed. Progress! 24.8.1 Text Companion: sample_data "],["video-segment-finishing-directors-index.html", "24.9 Video Segment: Finishing /directors index", " 24.9 Video Segment: Finishing /directors index -Notes: time stamp 00:42:10 to 00:51:10 moving Director.all from view template to controller .each to loop over @list_of_directors object, ActiveRecord::Relation formatting results into a table images with robohash (still necessary? works now…) linking to details page with flexible route and primary key, href=\"/director/&lt;%= a_director.id %&gt;\" Now that I have my data, we could return to a rails console and practice some more interesting queries: pry(main)&gt; Movie.count (0.1ms) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &quot;movies&quot; =&gt; 52 pry(main)&gt; Director.count (0.1ms) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &quot;directors&quot; =&gt; 34 We will need to read data more precisely than just listing it all out for our task. Before we do that, though, if we look at our target, and go to the list of all directors: /directors, then we will see that we have the necessary data to finish that page in our app. If you go back to the /directors page in our app, it actually looks like the only thing different compared to the target is that we have the information listed as bullets, and the target has it in a table with links for “Show details”. We will just need to work on the formatting. So let’s return to our view template and fix things: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of all directors&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;% Director.all.each do |a_director| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= a_director.name %&gt;, &lt;%= a_director.dob %&gt;, &lt;%= a_director.bio %&gt;, &lt;%= a_director.id %&gt;, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; We are just looping over a Director.all right in the view template. My preference here would be that we place this call in the controller and just have an instance variable with this array we can use in the view template: # app/controllers/directors_controller.rb class DirectorsController &lt; ApplicationController def index @list_of_directors = Director.all render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/index.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“5”} &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of all directors&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;% @list_of_directors.each do |a_director| %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;%= a_director.name %&gt;, &lt;%= a_director.dob %&gt;, &lt;%= a_director.bio %&gt;, &lt;%= a_director.id %&gt;, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; {: mark_lines=“5”} And rather than a list item, let’s format things into a table: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of all directors&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;% @list_of_directors.each do |a_director| %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.dob %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.bio %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.id %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“5 7-12 14”} All we did here was put each of our previous records into a separate row (&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;) and each attribute into a separate column in that row (&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;), all within a loop in our &lt;table&gt; element. If we refresh our /directors page and compare it with the target, we’ll see that we’re getting somewhere. But we do need to add table headings, move things around, add the images, and add a link to the director’s page with the bio rather than putting it all in that table. Let’s re-arrange things to match the target and add the image first: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of all directors&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;% @list_of_directors.each do |a_director| %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.id %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;%= a_director.image %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.dob %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“8-13”} Remember, we can embed Ruby code in the HTML tag attributes, so we’ve done that with the image URLs (contained in a_director.image) from our database records in the src=\"\" attribute to &lt;img&gt;. Using .each for looping over an ActiveRecord_Relation (an array of database rows) like @list_of_directors, and pulling out attributes to put them into embedded Ruby HTML documents is a huge part of our job! As a brief aside, if those images aren’t showing up on the page (for instance because the scraped image URLs are being blocked, which sometimes occurs), there’s actually another way that we can get some dummy images to fill in our table: using https://robohash.org. RoboHash lets developers put sample images into mockups while building stuff. Unique images are generated from any text (including our entire URL strings). All we need to do is replace src=\"&lt;%= a_director.image %&gt;\" with src=\"https://robohash.org/&lt;%= a_director.image %&gt;\". BENP: I note that the director image URLs do seem to work now so maybe this aside can be eliminated Okay, now let’s see how we can get the bio out of our table (it’s not in the target) and into the director’s detail page, which should be linked with “Show details”. In the target, if I click a link it will take me to a URL that looks like /director/1. The second path segment is the id column value of that director, the primary key! &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of all directors&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;% @list_of_directors.each do |a_director| %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.id %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;%= a_director.image %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.dob %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/director/1&quot;&gt; Show details &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“14-18”} If on our /director page in our app, we now click some of the “Show details” links, they all take us to /director/1, and they all have a “no route matches” error. How do we fill in the href=\"/director/1\" attribute to get the input link to take us to the correct page? And how do we get that page to show us the director information from the database, including the long bio? Well, for starters, we have a_director.id, which will give us the primary key for every director and we can fill in the link path with that: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/index.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of all directors&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;% @list_of_directors.each do |a_director| %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.id %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;%= a_director.image %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.name %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_director.dob %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/director/&lt;%= a_director.id %&gt;&quot;&gt; Show details &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“15”} Now when we click the link “Show details”, we are being brought to the correct path for a given director, but we still haven’t defined the routes or made the pages, so we’re not done yet. For this, you will need to use flexible routes. BENP: link to dynamic routes (or is it called flexible routes?) content 24.9.1 Text Companion: Finishing /directors Index "],["video-segment-database-query-with-.html", "24.10 Video Segment: Database Query with .where", " 24.10 Video Segment: Database Query with .where -Notes: time stamp 00:51:10 to 01:09:31 RCAV /directors/eldest query DB in rails console, building up to Director.where.not({ :dob =&gt; nil }).order({ :dob =&gt; :asc }).first put query into wisest action, and put @oldest director into view template app/views/director_templates/eldest.html.erb http://strftime.net/ to get .dob formatted Let’s work on something else first. In our target we have those pages for youngest and eldest . We will start with the /directors/eldest URL path in our app. As always, the first job is to make it say hello by following our RCAV: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;homepage&quot; }) get(&quot;/directors&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;directors&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/directors/eldest&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;directors&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;wisest&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“8”} And then: # app/controllers/directors_controller.rb class DirectorsController &lt; ApplicationController def index @list_of_directors = Director.all render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/index.html.erb&quot; }) end def wisest render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/eldest.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“10-13”} And (going right away to viewing the target source for the copy in our view template): &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/eldest.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Eldest director&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt; The eldest director in our dataset right now is Michael Curtiz, born on December 24, 1886. &lt;/p&gt; Now that we have something showing up on our page (refresh /directors/eldest to be sure), we need to get it to dynamically update by looking up the oldest director and showing their name (linked to their page) and date of birth. To figure out how to do this, we will play around in the rails console. So open a new terminal (or use one you have open that is not running bin/server), and start the console. If we do: pry(main)&gt; Director.count (0.1ms) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &quot;directors&quot; =&gt; 34 then we see we have 34 directors. And our columns can be shown with: pry(main)&gt; Director =&gt; Director(id: integer, name: string, dob: date, bio: text, image: string, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime) Now, how are we going to find the oldest director? What methods do we have at our disposal? We have many wonderful methods avaiable from ActiveRecord, so let’s familiarize ourselves with some of them. BENP: some of these notes come directly from zipping in active-record.md chapter content, could just be linked here. We will use the “Time to CRUD” section of this chapter as reference. We see much of the things we have already discussed in this section: how to use the console, how to create records and save them, and how to read. Please read the section, so you can see some of the methods you have available that we haven’t covered. For now, let’s have a look at one in particular, .order. This sorts an ActiveRecord_Relation based on some specified column and a specified direction: :asc for ascending, or :desc for descending. In addition to this handy method, we have the all-important .where. .where is, if I had to pick one, the most important of the read methods. This is how we filter the table based on some criteria. We pick a column and a criteria and we can filter the records down. And you can do this as many times as you want until you are left with just the records you need (in our case, one record). Let’s put these read methods to the test in querying our database for the oldest director! Can you take a moment in your console and try to do this yourself with the reference material linked? In particular this is important to keep in mind. It’s a little tricky, but I’ll wait… Okay let’s do it together. If I want the oldest director, then I will use the dob column from my table, that seems appropriate. First, I’ll order by that column (note, I don’t need to write .all, because it is standard to query all records in a database, so this is implicit): pry(main)&gt; Director.order({ :dob =&gt; :asc }).first We use :asc as the argument because in programming dates grow over time (they are stored as seconds BENP: are they stored as seconds?), so they get bigger and bigger, so the smallest dob column value is the oldest director. Thus, the first row in the ActiveRecord_Relation returned by this ordering should be what I want, so I call it with .first (or .at(0) is equivalent). If you leave off .first, then you will get the entire array of all rows, now ordered. But wait, the above console query returns: =&gt; #&lt;Director:0x00005615f9231698 id: 17, name: &quot;Kátia Lund&quot;, dob: nil, bio: nil, image: &quot;http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNTEzODc1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTUyMjIz._V1._SY314_CR13,0,214,314_.jpg&quot;, created_at: Wed, 12 Aug 2015 17:20:05 UTC +00:00, updated_at: Wed, 12 Aug 2015 17:20:05 UTC +00:00 That’s not right! Kátia Lund is definitely not the eldest director, and look, the dob is nil, or empty. The value nil actually counts as smaller than 0 in our ordering. We’re going to need to chain another query method if we want to avoid any nil values. How about .where? Or better yet, .where.not. Try to solve this yourself! Okay, if you didn’t already, try to enter something like: pry(main)&gt; Director.where.not({ :dob =&gt; nil }).order({ :dob =&gt; :asc }).first And that should return: =&gt; #&lt;Director:0x00005615f918d020 id: 19, name: &quot;Michael Curtiz&quot;, dob: Fri, 24 Dec 1886, bio: &quot;Curtiz began acting in and then directing films in his native Hungary in 1912. After WWI, he continued his filmmaking career in Austria and Germany and into the early 1920s when he directed films in other countries in Europe. M : Great! As an aside. Sometimes when you are typing these long query strings into the console you forget a parenthesis and you get stuck: [7] pry(main)&gt; Director.where.not({ :dob =&gt; nil }).order({ :dob =&gt; :asc }.first [7] pry(main)* Where you see the * symbol at the prompt on the next line, the console is still waiting for you to finish entering. The console is expecting more code! Nothing is working here. Well just remember you can always Ctrl + c to get out of that state and go back to fix the expression. Anyway, now that I’ve figured out the code in the rails console, let’s add it to our controller as an instance variable: # app/controllers/directors_controller.rb class DirectorsController &lt; ApplicationController def index @list_of_directors = Director.all render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/index.html.erb&quot; }) end def wisest @oldest = Director.where.not({ :dob =&gt; nil }).order({ :dob =&gt; :asc }).first render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/eldest.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“10-13”} And let’s put that instance variable into our view template, keeping in mind that this variable is a record from our database table with attributes (column values) that we can access: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/eldest.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Eldest director&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt; The eldest director in our dataset right now is &lt;%= @oldest.name %&gt;, born on &lt;%= @oldest.dob %&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; {: mark_lines=“6”} Now refresh /directors/eldest. Looking good! We can pretty easily get the director name to link to the director’s page like we did with the “Show details” links on /directors (we haven’t RCAV’d these links yet, but we will soon). Now, how can we get the formatting for the date of birth to match the target? Well for that we can use http://strftime.net/. You never need to memorize these odd string formating characters for dates. Just use a resource for strftime, and over time you may beging to grow familiar with them. With the help of that tool we can reformat the date like so: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/eldest.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Eldest director&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt; The eldest director in our dataset right now is &lt;a href=&quot;/directors/&lt;%= @director.id %&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;%= @oldest.name %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, born on &lt;%= @oldest.dob.strftime(&quot;%B %e, %Y&quot;) %&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; {: mark_lines=“6”} And our page is up and running like the target. By the way, have you been using rails grade to check your progress and /git committing when you get things working?!?! Do it now if you haven’t. 24.10.1 Text Companion: Database Query with .where "],["video-segment-flexible-routes-for-director-details.html", "24.11 Video Segment: Flexible Routes for Director Details", " 24.11 Video Segment: Flexible Routes for Director Details -Notes: time stamp 01:09:31 to 01:23:36 should title be “flexible” or “dynamic”? return to unfinished “Show details” links on index page importance of placement of static /director/eldest vs. flexible /director/:an_id in config/routes.rb fetch director ID from params and query DB first in rails console aside: using tp Movie.where({ :year =&gt; 1994 }), \"title\", \"year\", \"id\" in rails console to explore table place finished query in the action director_details and the director info in the view template time_ago_in_words() Now we need to make some flexible routes like /director/1, that accept the id number of a director in the second segment of the path. Let’s begin by visiting such a segment. First, notice that if we enter the URL path /director/eldest, this second segment eldest is not bringing us to a director page. That’s because the config/routes.rb file will search for and match routes starting top to bottom, so we just need to be careful where we put our new routes (they will need to be below the route we don’t want to be flexible): # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;homepage&quot; }) get(&quot;/directors&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;directors&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/directors/eldest&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;directors&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;wisest&quot; }) get(&quot;/directors/:an_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;directors&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;director_details&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“10”} If we put the new route above the /directors/eldest route, then we would lose our ability to reach that route! So we put it below. Long story short, if you define a flexible route that matches a static route that you want to have, make sure that your static routes come above your flexible routes. Now let’s make our director’s pages working. We know already about flexible routes. BENP: link to content / assignment here? We can get :an_id above out from our params variable. Visit a “Show details” link on the /directors page, and note in the GitPod terminal running bin/server: ... Parameters: {&quot;an_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;} ... Okay, let’s get this data into our controller: # app/controllers/directors_controller.rb class DirectorsController &lt; ApplicationController def index @list_of_directors = Director.all render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/index.html.erb&quot; }) end def wisest @oldest = Director.where.not({ :dob =&gt; nil }).order({ :dob =&gt; :asc }).first render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/eldest.html.erb&quot; }) end def director_details # params looks like {&quot;an_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;} the_id = params.fetch(&quot;an_id&quot;) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/show.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“16-22”} Now how do I get the actual director record that matches the_id? With a database query! Try it in our console: pry(main)&gt; Director.where({ :id =&gt; &quot;1&quot; }).first Director Load (0.3ms) SELECT &quot;directors&quot;.* FROM &quot;directors&quot; WHERE &quot;directors&quot;.&quot;id&quot; = ?

Brought to America as an infant : Don’t forget the .first or .at(0), or you will just get back an array rather than a single record. As another aside, you can view records in your console with some table printing. For instance, at the console we could view the movies. Like what if you wanted to show the movies that were made in 1994? pry(main)&gt; Movie.where({ :year =&gt; 1994 }) (0.1ms) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &quot;movies&quot; WHERE &quot;movies&quot;.&quot;year&quot; = ? [[&quot;year&quot;, 1994]] =&gt; Movie::ActiveRecord_Relation (array with 4 Movie instances inside) We see there are four movies, but how can we quick n’ dirty actually see them? We can use a nice method called “table print”, or tp: pry(main)&gt; tp Movie.where({ :year =&gt; 1994 }) Movie Load (0.2ms) SELECT &quot;movies&quot;.* FROM &quot;movies&quot; WHERE &quot;movies&quot;.&quot;year&quot; = ?

Now this is ugly, because it is printing every column, so we can also specify just a few columns like so, with comma separated values of strings: pry(main)&gt; tp Movie.where({ :year =&gt; 1994 }), &quot;title&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, &quot;id&quot; Movie Load (0.2ms) SELECT &quot;movies&quot;.* FROM &quot;movies&quot; WHERE &quot;movies&quot;.&quot;year&quot; = ?

The way this is done is simply wrapping the instance variable attribute, which come out as Time classes, in the inherited Rails function time_ago_in_words(), like: &lt;%= time_ago_in_words(@the_director.created_at) %&gt;. The “Show details” pages on /directors now appear to be working (test is manually yourself), so we can rails grade and /git commit, then move on to the next thing. 24.11.1 Text Companion: Flexible Routes for Director Details "],["video-segment-filmography.html", "24.12 Video Segment: Filmography", " 24.12 Video Segment: Filmography -Notes: time stamp 01:23:36 to 01:35:54 foreign keys for director_id in Movie rails console to show tp Movie.where({ :director_id =&gt; 1 }), \"title\", \"year\", \"id\" add query to director_details format filmography table in view template app/views/director_templates/show.html.erb, including the query: &lt;%= Director.where({ :id =&gt; a_film.director_id }).at(0).name %&gt; We now want our director’s pages to list the filmography (the movies) that each director made.

What if we did: pry(main)&gt; tp Movie.where({ :director_id =&gt; 1 }), &quot;title&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, &quot;id&quot; Movie Load (0.2ms) SELECT &quot;movies&quot;.* FROM &quot;movies&quot; WHERE &quot;movies&quot;.&quot;director_id&quot; = ? [[&quot;director_id&quot;, 1]] TITLE | YEAR | ID -------------------------|------|--- The Shawshank Redemption | 1994 | 1 =&gt; 0.00032467 We wanted to find all of the movies that had a given director (with id of 1). And we know our movies table keeps track of this director ID with the foreign key column director_id. So we just query our database table (the class Movie in Rails) for a given director_id, and we get back all of those records (nicely formatted above with tp and a few columns of interest). Let’s add this query to our action in the controller: # app/controllers/directors_controller.rb class DirectorsController &lt; ApplicationController def index @list_of_directors = Director.all render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/index.html.erb&quot; }) end def wisest @oldest = Director.where.not({ :dob =&gt; nil }).order({ :dob =&gt; :asc }).first render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/eldest.html.erb&quot; }) end def director_details # params looks like {&quot;an_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;} the_id = params.fetch(&quot;an_id&quot;) @the_director = Director.where({ :id =&gt; the_id }).first @filmography = Movie.where({ :director_id =&gt; @the_director.id }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;director_templates/show.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“21”} Noting above that we need to use the current director (@the_director) ID to query our database for just that person’s filmography. Also note, @filmography is an ActiveRecord_Relation array (we didn’t call .first or .at(0) on it) containing potentially many records. So in our view template we will need to loop over it with .each and format the attributes for each record into a table. Just like we did for the index action on our @list_of_directors! So now in our view template, we can: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Director #&lt;%= @the_director.id %&gt; details&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Name&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_director.name %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Dob&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_director.dob %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Bio&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_director.bio %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Image&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;img src=&lt;%= @the_director.image %&gt;&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Created at&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_director.created_at %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Updated at&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_director.updated_at %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Filmography&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;% @filmography.each do |a_film| %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_film.id %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;%= a_film.image %&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_film.title %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_film.year %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_film.director_id %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“22-32”} If we click around now on our “Show details” pages on /directors, then we should see the table of filmographies updating on each page. But there’s something pesky. Right now we are showing users a column with a_film.director_id, which is just the ID number of the director. We don’t every want to show users ID numbers, we want to show them information associated with that id. In this case, we want the name of the director, but that’s not a column we have in a_flim, which comes from our movies table. So how to get this? We could use the @the_director.name from above since we are on this page, but ignore this for a moment. If we didn’t have the name already available, we could use another database query and a mix of invisible and visible embedded Ruby tags: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Director #&lt;%= @the_director.id %&gt; details&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Name&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_director.name %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Dob&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_director.dob %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Bio&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_director.bio %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Image&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;img src=&lt;%= @the_director.image %&gt;&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Created at&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_director.created_at %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Updated at&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_director.updated_at %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Filmography&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;% @filmography.each do |a_film| %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_film.id %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;%= a_film.image %&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_film.title %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_film.year %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;% d = Director.where({ :id =&gt; a_film.director_id }).at(0) %&gt; &lt;%= d.name %&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“31-34”} Okay, now that we have a filmography we’ve really circled back on all of the early stuff we talked about with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. This is what makes our applications powerful! Now, after a rails grade and potentially a /git commit if everything is work, the rest of the project to match the target is up to you. 24.12.1 Text Companion: Filmography "],["finish-and-submit-msm-queries.html", "24.13 Finish and Submit MSM Queries", " 24.13 Finish and Submit MSM Queries 24.13.1 Additional Query Tasks for Practice Notes: from https://github.com/appdev-projects/msm-queries#tasks 24.13.1.1 Finding a movie by title How many years ago was “Casablanca” released?

Notes: time stamp 00:01:45 to 00:06:57 explore target, which is a solution to MSM Queries technical debt, refactoring automated tests with rails grade Here’s the plan for today’s assignment. First, we’re going to look at a project called refactoring MSM queries. The starting point of that assignment is the ending point for MSM queries. So once you set up your workspace you’ll have a solution for the homework. So the first thing that you should do is look through the starting point for refactoring MSM queries. Compare this solution to your solution. Compare my code to your code and try to think of some questions about the choices that I made. If nothing else, compare my actor details view template and your actor details view template, because there is a lot going on there. Practice reading the code and reasoning your way through it, line by line; explain it to yourself, or to your rubber ducky. Developers read far more code than we write. Here is the assignment. As usual: Start the web server by running bin/server. Navigate to your live application preview. As you work, remember to navigate to /git and Always Be Committing. Organize your workspace tabs. BENP: Added this step! Run rails grade as often as you like to see how you are doing, but make sure you test your app manually first to make sure it matches the target’s behavior. BENP: possible image(s) (better, GIFs?) of starting a workspace, opening /git, organizing tabs, noting the target favicon. But these are probably in a different chapter. The target for this project is here. It is the same as MSM Queries, because the functionality is unchanged, just refactored! A refactoring will not change the visual appearance, or anything related to functionality. On a team, when you go through a refactoring sprint or chunk of work, your users should not be affected. We’re just trying to improve the code base and pay off technical debt. A lot of times we know it’s not the best way it could be done, we know there’s repetitive stuff, so refactoring is when we pause, freeze the functionality and pay off the technical debt. And that’s why automated tests like rails grade are amazing. We’ve been writing all the automated tests for you and we just run them with Rails. But in a real world setting, refactoring is where automated tests really pay off. If you don’t have automated tests, you never pay off that technical debt because you’re afraid of breaking something. We’re going to make the code much more modular and re-usable, while keeping the functionality exactly the same. How? By defining methods to encapsulate our querying logic. 28.1.1 Text Companion: Exploring the Target, What is Refactoring? "],["video-segment-actor-details-show-page.html", "28.2 Video Segment: Actor Details show Page", " 28.2 Video Segment: Actor Details show Page Notes: time stamp 00:06:57 to 00:09:14 examine view template and show action in app/controllers/actors_controller.rb reiterate ActiveRecord::Relation Now that we have our bin/server running, I’m going to visit an actor details page myself in the browser of my app. If you don’t have any data in this brand new project and workspace, open up a new terminal, run rails sample_data, and get some stuff to look at. Once you have data you can click through the list of actors at /actors and find Morgan Freeman, then “Show details” to end up on that page with the URL path /actors/2 (or whatever Morgan Freeman’s id number is in that second path segment). You see I have the filmography on the page. So this is a working version MSM Queries to begin with. Let’s zoom in on the actual code by opening the actor details view template: &lt;!-- app/views/actor_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Actor #&lt;%= @the_actor.id %&gt; details &lt;/h1&gt; ... &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt; Name &lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt; &lt;%= @the_actor.name %&gt; &lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt; Dob &lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt; &lt;%= @the_actor.dob %&gt; &lt;/dd&gt; ... &lt;/dl&gt; ... I have this instance variable called @the_actor, which I set up in the action that I made in the controller: # app/controllers/actors_controller.rb class ActorsController &lt; ApplicationController def index matching_actors = Actor.all @list_of_actors = matching_actors.order({ :created_at =&gt; :desc }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;actor_templates/index.html.erb&quot; }) end def show the_id = params.fetch(&quot;path_id&quot;) matching_actors = Actor.where({ :id =&gt; the_id }) @the_actor = matching_actors.at(0) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;actor_templates/show.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“11-18”} I did this standard dance, which we’re going to be doing a lot, which is get the id number out of the path. This is the dynamic segment of the path: path_id. And then look up the actors where that value appears in the id column. That .where method returns an ActiveRecord::Relation in the matching_actors variable. ActiveRecord::Relations contain some number of records, which match the search criteria that we put in. If you’re searching an id column, of course we know there’s only going to be one record and that’s unique. Or there might be zero records in case we provide an id that doesn’t exist. There’s only going to be zero or one. But we still have to get that first element out of the relation, so we use .at(0) to get the @the_actor instance variable for the view template. 28.2.1 Text Companion: Actor Details show Page "],["video-segment-activerecordrelation-review.html", "28.3 Video Segment: ActiveRecord::Relation Review", " 28.3 Video Segment: ActiveRecord::Relation Review Notes: time stamp 00:09:14 to 00:12:05 rails console to explore ActiveRecord objects To review, an ActiveRecord::Relation is very similar to an array, but in this case the only thing they can contain are individual ActiveRecord objects, which are rows in the table. These rows then have attributes (column values) that we can get data from using the column accessor method. For instance, at the rails console: pry(main)&gt; m = Movie.all (0.1ms) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &quot;movies&quot; =&gt; Movie::ActiveRecord::Relation (array with 52 Movie instances inside) .all returns an array-like object with 52 movie instances, and when I get the first one out: pry(main)&gt; x = m.first Movie Load (0.2ms) SELECT &quot;movies&quot;.* FROM &quot;movies&quot; ORDER BY &quot;movies&quot;.&quot;id&quot; ASC LIMIT ?

So first, we’re using the instance variable, the @the_actor objects, and we’re saying .name, .dob, etc., which you can do because these columns exist. So we get a method for each column, a column acts as a method for free from ActiveRecord, we didn’t have to define them. Then I get down to the filmography part of the page lower down: &lt;!-- app/views/actor_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; ... &lt;h2&gt;Filmography&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; ... &lt;% a_id = @the_actor.id %&gt; &lt;% matching_characters = Character.where({ :actor_id =&gt; a_id }) %&gt; &lt;% matching_characters.each do |a_character| %&gt; &lt;% m_id = a_character.movie_id %&gt; &lt;% matching_movies = Movie.where({ :id =&gt; m_id }) %&gt; &lt;% the_movie = matching_movies.at(0) %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;%= the_movie.title %&gt; &lt;/td&gt; ... &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“10-19”} If you remember the domain model here, actors and movies are in a many-to-many relationship and they’re joined by characters. These tables have associated classes in our Rails app in the app/models/ folder, and the classes are named Actor, Movie, and Character. If we recall by looking at /rails/db, our visual database browser, and navigating to the characters table, then we see there is a movie_id and actor_id. So first I got the current actor ID because we are on the page of @the_actor: &lt;% a_id = @the_actor.id %&gt;` which is just a column like any other column, so I get this accessor method .id. Then I looked at the records in the characters table with a matching actor_id: &lt;% matching_characters = Character.where({ :actor_id =&gt; a_id }) %&gt; Now I have an ActiveRecord::Relation of characters, and each of these have a movie_id. Then I’m going to do a .each on the matching_characters, and for each of these rows, put it in a block variable a_character, pull out the movie_id from the row, and look up this movie in the movies table to iteratively fill the table with movie information, like the_movie.title, in my loop: &lt;% matching_characters.each do |a_character| %&gt; &lt;% m_id = a_character.movie_id %&gt; &lt;% matching_movies = Movie.where({ :id =&gt; m_id }) %&gt; &lt;% the_movie = matching_movies.at(0) %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;%= the_movie.title %&gt; &lt;/td&gt; If we look further down in the filmography section, to show the director of the movie: &lt;!-- app/views/actor_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; ... &lt;h2&gt;Filmography&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; ... &lt;td&gt; &lt;% d_id = the_movie.director_id %&gt; &lt;% matching_directors = Director.where({ :id =&gt; d_id }) %&gt; &lt;% the_director = matching_directors.at(0) %&gt; &lt;%= the_director.name %&gt; &lt;/td&gt; ... &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“10-15”} I need to use the director_id column from my current movie: &lt;% d_id = the_movie.director_id %&gt; and look that director up in the directors table: &lt;% matching_directors = Director.where({ :id =&gt; d_id }) %&gt; &lt;% the_director = matching_directors.at(0) %&gt; then call .name on the row to get my table value: &lt;%= the_director.name %&gt; We’re jumping through all four tables here! Actor to Character, Character to Movie, and Movie to Director! That’s how pretty much all database relationships work. If we can do this, we can do anything. 28.4.1 Text Companion: Actor Details Filmography "],["video-segment-defining-instance-methods-in-the-model.html", "28.5 Video Segment: Defining Instance Methods in the Model", " 28.5 Video Segment: Defining Instance Methods in the Model Notes: time stamp 00:15:31 to 00:22:09 define title_with_year in app/models/movie.rb see refactoring-msm-queries-with-methods.md section “Instance method review” use of self. in model method apply new method to app/views/movie_templates/show.html.erb Let’s look at some techniques that we use to make this much easier on ourselves and more efficient for our teams. Let’s take the Movie class. All we do when we want to start using ActiveRecord, is we create the model. We put it in the app/models/ folder, named after the table singular movie.rb, define the class there inheriting from ApplicationRecord, and then boom, magically, we get a whole bunch of methods. And this is still app/models/movie.rb file is still empty. But, the power of object oriented programming, which is what Ruby is, is that we can add our own methods to this class and encapsulate frequently used logic in a nicely named method. So we don’t have to keep doing it over and over again. For example, let’s just say in the movie details view template page: &lt;!-- app/views/movie_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Movie #&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt; details &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/movies&quot;&gt; Go back &lt;/a&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“4”} Right now I have the movie ID number in the page heading. Let’s say I want to replace that with the movie title, and next to it I want the year it was released in parantheses: &lt;!-- app/views/movie_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt; &lt;%= @the_movie.name %&gt; (&lt;%= @the_movie.year %&gt;) &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/movies&quot;&gt; Go back &lt;/a&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“4”} That works if you visit a given movie details page like /movies/1. And I could repeat this pattern all over the place. But that’s not great. What if I just want to have that string pre-assembled? In our rails console that we opened previously using string interpolation: pry(main)&gt; &quot;#{x.title} (#{x.year})&quot; =&gt; &quot;The Shawshank Redemption (1994)&quot; I can create a method in my model! Let’s create this: # app/models/movie.rb # == Schema Information # # Table name: movies # # id :integer not null, primary key # description :text # duration :integer # image :string # title :string # year :integer # created_at :datetime not null # updated_at :datetime not null # director_id :integer # class Movie &lt; ApplicationRecord def title_with_year return &quot;howdy!&quot; end end {: mark_lines=“16-18”} BENP: have we ever up to this point seen a function with a return statement? Note the # == Schema Information in the header of this file. This is the same as the “Schema” tab that we say previously on /rails/db, and it serves as a nice reference for what is contained in the table movies associated with the file movie.rb, and the Movie class contained therein. Now in our view template we can say: &lt;!-- app/views/movie_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt; &lt;%= @the_movie.title_with_year %&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/movies&quot;&gt; Go back &lt;/a&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“4”} And if you reload the browser page with your movie details, you will see “howdy!” at the top. The point is, you can define whatever method you want in the model file. And then you can call those methods on any movie wherever you have that movie object. So now I can do something better, like: # app/models/movie.rb ... def title_with_year return &quot;#{self.title} (#{self.year})&quot; end ... {: mark_lines=“5”} We get the title and year from whichever movie this method is being run on, and that is what the keyword self. is for. When you’re defining an instance method, and you need to call some other instance method, in order to make this instance method work, the self. keyword gives us a way to call the other instance method within the definition of this instance method. BENP: this is somewhat confusing wording. needs to be stated clearly and maybe linked to previous material. Right now there is a very long section called “Instance method review” in refactoring-msm-queries-with-methods.md that goes into this. Try to reload the movie details page at /movies/1. You should see the title and year instead of “howdy!”. So now I have this method that my whole team can use for the next ten years, saving us from tons of duplication and potential bugs! 28.5.1 Text Companion: Defining Instance Methods in the Model "],["video-segment-moviedirector.html", "28.6 Video Segment: Movie#director", " 28.6 Video Segment: Movie#director Notes: time stamp 00:22:09 to 00:29:19 define director in app/models/movie.rb to get rid of query in view templates and replace with @the_movie.director apply new method to app/views/movie_templates/show.html.erb 1-N association Let’s define a really handy one now.

This should all work and we can now see the director on the page. Sure this works, but it’s pretty annoying. What if I just had a method I could call that looked like @the_movie.director, which just returns the director record (d above), and I can avoid several lines of embedded code? Let’s do it. # app/models/movie.rb ... class Movie &lt; ApplicationRecord def title_with_year return &quot;#{self.title} (#{self.year})&quot; end def director the_director = Director.where({ :id =&gt; self.director_id }).at(0) return the_director end end {: mark_lines=“9-12”} Again, we are using self. to get the director_id of the object that this method is called on, which is an instance of the Movie object (@the_movie on our view template page). Then we look up this ID in the directors table in the id column using the Director model that we defined. And now we can just return this single record! So now in our view template, we can replace the previous multiline code with: &lt;!-- app/views/movie_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt; &lt;%= @the_movie.title_with_year %&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Directed by &lt;%= @the_movie.director.name %&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/movies&quot;&gt; Go back &lt;/a&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“8”} We get our @the_movie.director object, which is a whole row of the directors table, and we can get the name using our attribute accessor method for that object. We could even do @the_movie.director.dob or @the_movie.director.bio to get other information about the director in that row. Reload /movies/1 and you will see the intended result! Our new instance method encapsulates the one-to-many association between movies and directors, and we (and our team) can use it anywhere. It dramatically simplifies our work. If you take the time, especially for these one-to-many and many-to-many associations, which we work with a lot, and define a method, then it makes other things much easier. 28.6.1 Text Companion: Movie#director "],["video-segment-directorfilmography.html", "28.7 Video Segment: Director#filmography", " 28.7 Video Segment: Director#filmography Notes: time stamp 00:29:19 to 00:33:34 other side of 1-N association define filmography in app/models/director.rb to get rid of query in view templates and replace with @the_director.filmography apply new method to app/views/director_templates/show.html.erb We make these associations a lot, so it’s convention after we have our models in our Rails app, to encapsulate them in instance methods immediately. And we call the method the singular of the other table like def director, if it’s the one-side of a one-to-many relationship. Of course there’s another side of this one-to-many relationship: a director can have many movies. On my director details view template in the filmography section, I will find a bit of code like: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; ... &lt;% the_id = @the_director.id %&gt; &lt;% matching_movies = Movie.where({ :director_id =&gt; the_id }) %&gt; &lt;% films = matching_movies.order({ :year =&gt; :asc }) %&gt; &lt;% films.each do |a_movie| %&gt; ... This is a similar but inverse procedure from before. Before, we started with the foreign key and looked up the primary key, and here it is the opposite. We start with the record @the_director, get the primary key id of that, look up this primary key in the foreign key column of movies, and then loop through the resulting records in matching_movies. In this case, we also sorted the resulting records into chronologically ascending order with the year column prior to looping. What we want instead here is a method that looks like: @the_director.filmography, that will give us back the matching_movies variable, and avoid all these lines of code. Well, let’s now go into our director.rb model and code in this method: # app/models/director.rb ... class Director &lt; ApplicationRecord def filmography the_films = Movie.where({ :director_id =&gt; self.id }).order({ :year =&gt; :asc }) return the_films end end {: mark_lines=“5-8”} Again, we see the opposite logic from last time when we wanted the director of a movie. Here we have the primary key from the director (self.id), and we want to look up all similar ids in the foreign key of the movies table. Again, we are chaining an .order method here, so the returned records are chronologically ordered for our looping step. Armed with this new method we can replace the all the previous code in our view template with just one line: &lt;!-- app/views/director_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; ... &lt;% @the_director.filmography.each do |a_movie| %&gt; ... 28.7.1 Text Companion: Director#filmography "],["video-segment-additional-association-accessor-methods.html", "28.8 Video Segment: Additional Association Accessor Methods", " 28.8 Video Segment: Additional Association Accessor Methods Notes: time stamp 00:33:34 to 00:59:46 work independently to define additional 1-N associations BENP: recording is just class working independently for most of this time All of this is what we call association accessor methods, and we do it at the beginning of every project. The first step is we create our data model, we figure out our columns, our tables, our one-to-manys and our many-to-manys. Then, as soon as we start writing code, as soon as we create our model files, we first write these methods on both sides of the relationship that need them to make querying much easier. We have some other association accessor methods that we need to define our current data model. There are three 1-N associations:: # Director =&gt; Movie # Movie =&gt; Character # Actor =&gt; Character You should try to define the six methods needed: # Director#filmography (we did this!) # Movie#director (and this!) # Movie#characters # Character#movie # Actor#characters # Character#actor Defining these last four is your job. Try and do this on your own based on the two sides of the 1-N that we defined, and run rails grade and /git commit as you get things working!

I am filtering the characters table above by the primary key of the currenty movie, in the foreign key column of that table. We get back potentially multiple rows, so we don’t need a .at(0). On the other side of this relationship in character.rb, we can do: # app/models/character.rb ... class Character &lt; ApplicationRecord def movie return Movie.where({ :id =&gt; self.movie_id }).at(0) end end {: mark_lines=“5-7”} And now we go to the movies table with our foreign key from the current character, and filter the primary keys to get the one movie that matches with .at(0). And now for the last 1-N, we start with the many characters that can be associated to one actor: # app/models/actor.rb ... class Actor &lt; ApplicationRecord def characters return Character.where({ :actor_id =&gt; self.id }) end end {: mark_lines=“5-7”} And back in our character.rb, the one actor associated with a given character: # app/models/character.rb ... class Character &lt; ApplicationRecord def movie return Movie.where({ :id =&gt; self.movie_id }).at(0) end def actor return Actor.where({ :id =&gt; self.actor_id }).at(0) end end {: mark_lines=“9-11”} Are you seeing the patterns and similarities? In many cases we can just copy-paste and change the name of the table! 28.9.1 Text Companion: Additional Association Accessor Methods Solved "],["video-segment-applying-association-accessor-methods.html", "28.10 Video Segment: Applying Association Accessor Methods", " 28.10 Video Segment: Applying Association Accessor Methods Notes: time stamp 01:05:57 to 01:12:15 replace all DB queries with 1-N association accessor methods in the view templates Any place where we have a database query in one of the 1-N associations, we want to replace it.

And now on the actor details page, replace this: &lt;!-- app/views/actor_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; ... &lt;% a_id = @the_actor.id %&gt; &lt;% matching_characters = Character.where({ :actor_id =&gt; a_id }) %&gt; &lt;% matching_characters.each do |a_character| %&gt; &lt;% m_id = a_character.movie_id %&gt; &lt;% matching_movies = Movie.where({ :id =&gt; m_id }) %&gt; &lt;% the_movie = matching_movies.at(0) %&gt; ... with: &lt;!-- app/views/actor_templates/show.html.erb --&gt; ... &lt;% @the_actor.characters.each do |a_character| %&gt; &lt;% the_movie = a_character.movie %&gt; ...

This became dramatically simpler here. We have these methods to traverse through all of our tables. Let’s make sure this all works by manually visiting the pages and checking, and then running our automated tests with rails grade to insure that our refactoring did not break anything and introduce regressions. We didn’t gain any new superpowers as far as new features that we’re able to build. But our code base is so much more maintainable now. It’s going to be so much easier for us to build new features now that we have these association accessor methods. 28.10.1 Text Companion: Applying Association Accessor Methods "],["finish-and-submit-refactoring-msm-queries.html", "28.11 Finish and Submit Refactoring MSM Queries", " 28.11 Finish and Submit Refactoring MSM Queries "],["domain-modeling.html", "29 Domain Modeling", " 29 Domain Modeling Notes: This is classroom work, but there is room here for a video+text walkthrough of ideas.firstdraft Day 6 recording video is partially transcribed in day-6-recording.md.

I wrote down what was said but no screenshots. Video is pretty good as is up to this point. In this project, Photogram GUI, we’re finally going to be building a Graphical User Interface, for our users to CRUD, Create, Read, Update and Delete data into our database tables. We’ve already done a lot of work with the R part. Given some data, we have displayed that data in our webpages a whole bunch of different ways. We’ve done really complicated queries to display that data. We’ve shown the rows in a table, we’ve shown an individual record details based on the ID number in the URL, and we’re using params. We also showed the records associated to an individual record in a one-to-many association. For example, the movies in the filmography for a director. We put those movies right on the details page in the director. So that was pretty great. We also showed, in a many-to-many relationship, the rows associated to a record. For example, on the actor details page, we showed all of the movies in a filmography. So we’ve done actually, believe it or not, quite advanced queries, if you ask a database person. And all without really thinking too hard about it. All we were doing was using .where, our bread-and-butter query method, and using what we have been thinking about since week one: foreign keys and join tables to connect our entities together in 1-N and N-N relationships, and doing lookups. And that’s all CRUD applications boil down to. Okay, but we’re missing one huge thing, which is, how do we get the data into the database in the first place? So far, we’ve been relying on rails console (manual entry), /rails/db (visual interface), and rails sample_data (rake task for sample data). We need to give our users a way to enter data. The whole point of our applications was keeping track of important information on behalf of our users: record keeping. And so we spent the first couple of weeks figuring out how to think of what that information is, and design database tables to keep track of that information. Let’s give them some forms (&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;) to fill out so that they can tell us their information (&lt;label&gt;&lt;/label&gt; and &lt;input&gt;). And then when they click submit (&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;) on those forms, we know that that information is going to go to some other URL, specified by the action attribute of the opening form tag (&lt;form action=\"/URL/here/\"&gt;). The information they provide in the form is going to be put into the query string on that next URL (/URL/here?input_one=foo&amp;input_two=bar), and then Rails is going to stick all that into the params hash. And then we can take all that stuff out of the params hash in that second action. Phew! In the past, we just computed some stuff and then kind of showed them some output and then forgot about all that stuff. Or maybe we put it into a cookie that we store in their browser, which is useful for a whole bunch of stuff, especially sign-in and sign-up in the next week. BENP: we didn’t talk about cookies up to this point, maybe leave out Now, we’re going to take all that information from the user and save it into a record in our database, rather than us, the developers, using rails console, /rails/db, and/or rails sample_data. And so it’s all going to finally come together. Everything we learned about routing, RCAV, params, forms, all that stuff. And everything we’ve been learning about ActiveRecord and databases, that’s finally going to come together, and we’re going to build our target Photogram app. 30.1.1 Text Companion: CRUD with Forms "],["video-segment-explore-the-target.html", "30.2 Video Segment: Explore the Target", " 30.2 Video Segment: Explore the Target Notes: time stamp 00:05:11 to 00:10:05 CRUD in relation to Photogram GUI BENP: here’s where screenshots or GIFs could be inserted It’s very simple. Right now it’s just a list of users and photos. Next week, we’re going to add the final piece of this, which is cookies for sign-in and sign-up. But right now, anybody can just add users and it just adds the record to the table. So there are no accounts yet. It’s just like adding an actor or adding a director. We are just adding records to the table right now. There’s a form to add /users. There’s a form to add /photos. And that’s what we have to wire up. In addition to that, if we go into the details page of a user, like /users/desmond, there’s also a form with the username pre-populated. Notice this URL /users/desmond isn’t an ID number, but it’s a username, and follows the same principle as putting the ID number. We know how to build a route where this can vary, and then take that information and use it to populate a page. We did that! We’re going to do that again, but now we’re going put a form in here and let them update some information. If we change the username with the form to “desmond2” and click “Update user”, I come back to the same URL, but now changed to /users/desmond2. Now, similarly, you’ve got /photos, and you can go to the details page of one, say /photos/861. There’s a another edit form here, and again if I change something and click “Update photo”, I’ll end up back on the details page and that change has been persisted. And I can delete the photo. If I scroll down farther on the photo details page, there’s a section for “Comments”, and I can add a new comment. Now, when I’m adding a new comment, I have to type in an “Author ID”, which is kind of annoying. You have to provide a valid ID number, or it’s not going to work. So there’s a new concept of validation. BENP: validates is used in this project and there are notes and examples below, but this is covered in much more detail in data-integrity-with-validations.md chapter: https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/845, and optional project: https://github.com/appdev-projects/msm-validations Okay, so there’s some work to be done to get here to this target. Believe it or not, little of this is new. We’ve done forms, we’ve done params, we’ve done dynamic routes, we’ve done ActiveRecord, and we’ve done CRUD at the rails console (e.g., with .new, then add attribute values, then .save). It might help to actually keep that CRUD chapter section handy for reference. In fact, another useful chapter to keep open for reference is the compendium one reference chapter, which is a concise class and method reference. BENP: editorialized that last sentence, which you bring up a few minutes later in video Let’s get started. 30.2.1 Text Companion: Explore the Target "],["video-segment-explore-the-erd.html", "30.3 Video Segment: Explore the ERD", " 30.3 Video Segment: Explore the ERD Notes: time stamp 00:10:10 to 00:18:15 examine /rails/db, run rails sample_data examine ERD (https://github.com/appdev-projects/photogram-gui/blob/master/erd.png) discuss 1-N and N-N relationships in the domain As usual, I’m going to start with config/routes.rb, because that’s the entry point to any Rails application: the list of URLs a user can visit. You can also use the tool /rails/info in the browser of your workspace, which will answer the same question: what requests does this Rails app respond to right now? Open that file now: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do end It’s empty! Looks like we need to build it all from scratch… not quite true. If I visit /rails/db in my browser, I at least have database tables created for comments, follow_requests, likes, photos, and users. We’ve been planning this architecture for a long time for our social network. The database is, however, empty, and we don’t have any routes defined. We can hope that someone wrote a rake task to populate our database with sample data… and if you run rails sample_data at the terminal in GitPod you will find that this is the case! If we click on the users table in /rails/db (taking us to /rails/db/tables/users/data), we see we have lots of columns, and it might help to actually view our domain model: This is our Entity Relationship Diagram or ERD. I like to include such diagrams with my project README. In fact there’s a gem that generates such ERDs for you. Remember we have users and photos in a 1-N association. I called the foreign key owner_id in photos, to keep track of which user owns which photo. Conventionally we would call the foreign key whatever the other table is called with an _id, user_id in this case. But, sometimes we want something more descriptive, and in the end it is up to me, the developer to choose these names. Photos also have caption, comments_count, and likes_count. I didn’t necessarily even need the _count columns, since these could be looked up with the photo foreign key columns. But it’s nice to keep the value here so I can use .order by the number of likes for sorting the records. We also have a join table for an N-N relationship called likes with the two foreign keys fan_id (from users table) and photo_id (from photos table). Again, we see a more descriptive name chosen in this case than the conventional user_id for this table. Now we have our comments table, which is very similar to likes, with foreign key columns for the users (author_id here) and photos (photo_id again), and the addition of the comment text in the body column. Within the users table we also have an internal N-N relationship, since one user can have many followers and leaders, and this is captured in the follow_requests table. We note that here the model classname will be FollowRequest (snake_case to CamelCase and made singular). Follow requests has two foreign key columns, both from the users table: recipient_id and sender_id. There is also the status column for keeping track of whether the “pending” request was “accepted” or “rejected”. We won’t tackle all of this now. Today, we are just building an interface for users to enter records into these tables, update them, and delete them. This means we’re going to have to do a lot of RCAV to set everything up. 30.3.1 Text Companion: Explore the ERD "],["video-segment-explore-model-classes.html", "30.4 Video Segment: Explore Model Classes", " 30.4 Video Segment: Explore Model Classes Notes: time stamp 00:18:15 to 00:20:58 examine app/models/user.rb association accessor instance methods there and in other models validates (first mention, only detailed later in https://github.com/appdev-projects/msm-validations and data-integrity-with-validations.md) But we actually have even more in our starting point that will help us. The model files are already in the project, for instance, you can find: # app/models/user.rb # == Schema Information # # Table name: users # # id :integer not null, primary key # comments_count :integer # likes_count :integer # private :boolean # username :string # created_at :datetime not null # updated_at :datetime not null # class User &lt; ApplicationRecord validates(:username, { :presence =&gt; true, :uniqueness =&gt; { :case_sensitive =&gt; false }, }) def comments my_id = self.id matching_comments = Comment.where({ :author_id =&gt; my_id }) return matching_comments end ... end And these are full of association accessor instance methods BENP: I have not been using or have been loose with instance vs class method, probably need to comb through everything and check consistency, like comments above, which you can use out-of-the-box to query across your tables. This is what we spent all the time building when we refactored MSM queries, and you get it here for free. Note that there are also some validates functions, which we haven’t discussed yet, to do the validations of data entered into our tables. BENP: here is the first mention of validates, which we use here, but is covered much more in chapter/project that follows Photogram GUI: https://github.com/appdev-projects/msm-validations The comments method will return a list of comments made by a given user, and would be used like a_user.comments. This is an ActiveRecord::Relation returned, and one could .each over the rows to display data on a page! No need for writing out these queries over and over again on your view templates. Ever! Take a look at the model files for each table in app/models. Spend time reading them. There are a lot of methods and having them are going to make our job a lot easier.

The homepage / in our target is the list of users (also at the path /users).

That means we name the controller for the page after the table plural. For the action that just lists our records, we call it index. Now we create that controller and action: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def index render({ :template =&gt; &quot;user_templates/index.html.erb&quot; }) end end Now we create the view template user_templates/index.html.erb, place some copy there (why not.. “hi”?), and view it in our browser at / or /users: &lt;!--- app/views/user_templates/index.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;hi&lt;/h1&gt; We can view the target, and see that we want a table with a list of users here. So let’s put some mockup in our view template based on what we see there: &lt;!--- app/views/user_templates/index.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of users&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt; ID &lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt; Username &lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“3-18”} If we now refresh the /users URL, this is going to make a blank table with three columns that we want to fill in with the ID, username, and a “Show details” link. So now we need all of the user records from our users table. What we want is something like: &lt;!--- app/views/user_templates/index.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of users&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt; ID &lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt; Username &lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% @list_of_users.each do |a_user| %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;%= a_user.id %&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;%= a_user.username %&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Show details &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“19-33”} We want an instance variable to loop over in our front-end. Specifically we want a list of rows from our users table and then we can get things like the .id and .username from each row. We’ll make the “Show details” link work later. Let’s go back to our action in the back-end and prepare this instance variable @list_of_users: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def index @list_of_users = User.all.order({ :username =&gt; :asc }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;user_templates/index.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“5”} And now, since we defined the variable, if we refresh /users in our browser, then we will see the populated table with our list of records with no error messages. And we even ordered is alphabetically by username using .order({ :username =&gt; :asc }) in the action. Now would be a good time for a rails grade and a /git commit if everything is working like the target. 30.5.1 Text Companion: Users index "],["video-segment-user-details-show.html", "30.6 Video Segment: User Details show", " 30.6 Video Segment: User Details show Notes: time stamp 00:27:25 to 00:47:40 more on validates (probably should be moved from here) RCAV a details page with flexible / dynamic routes, using /users/:path_username redirect_to if nil user, otherwise render({ :template =&gt; \"user_templates/show.html.erb\" }) “Own photos” table with association accessor methods @the_user.own_photos and a_photo.poster.username Faker gem We still need to make the “Show details” link work.

But every user has to have a valid username, which we saw in our model, but didn’t discuss: # app/models/user.rb ... class User &lt; ApplicationRecord validates(:username, { :presence =&gt; true, :uniqueness =&gt; { :case_sensitive =&gt; false }, }) ... end What is this saying? Well we are using the inherited function validates() and the first argument is the column of our users table, username. The second argument is a hash containing some requirements for the username value. It must be present, so it must exist, with :presence =&gt; true, and it must be unique among users and case-sensitive, with :uniqueness =&gt; { :case_sensitive =&gt; false }. So a user must include a username, it must not exist in the table, and if a user like “raghu” exists, then “Raghu” won’t work. BENP: this aside about validates could be removed. Actually probably not because comes back below (see my note there) Before we get “Show details” to work on our index page, we need to build the show action, which is the user details page. Just like how we had movie or director details. If in our app we go to /users/austin (or any other username in our table), then we get the “no route matches” error and we can start debugging the RCAV: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/users&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/users/:path_username&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“7”} We are using a dynamic route with the second segment :path_username, which we know will end up in our params, and we use the conventional action name for showing the details of a record, show. Now we create that action and show something in our view template: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController ... def show render({ :template =&gt; &quot;user_templates/show.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“5-7”} Right away we put in some mockup to match the target here: &lt;!--- app/views/user_templates/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;username&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;ID&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;user_id&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Edit user&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Form goes here&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Own photos (photo count count goes here)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;/table&gt; Of course, we will now need to fill in the static HTML here with dynamic embedded Ruby to get the page to work for each user. In my server log on GitPod (the terminal running bin/server), we can see that anything I put in the second segment of /users/austin, will end up in the params, like {\"path_username\"=&gt;\"austin\"}. That is available in our show action. So let’s make it work now: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController ... def show url_username = params.fetch(&quot;path_username&quot;) @the_user = User.where({ :username =&gt; url_username }).first render({ :template =&gt; &quot;user_templates/show.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“6-7”} We got the username from the URL path, then we used that username to find the matching record in our users table by searching the username column (which we have access to through the User model). We are expecting one record, so we use .first to get back a single object, our instance variable @the_user, which we’ll use in our view template. But wait! This @the_user could be empty or nil, if there is no valid username that was entered in the URL found in our table. What do we do then? Well we can check on this and redirect if necessary: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController ... def show url_username = params.fetch(&quot;path_username&quot;) @the_user = User.where({ :username =&gt; url_username }).first if @the_user == nil redirect_to(&quot;/&quot;) else render({ :template =&gt; &quot;user_templates/show.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“9-12”} So now if you get back a nil user, then you are redirected to the homepage, otherwise you are taken to the details page. Now, if we really wanted to write our code defensively like this, we would need to put similar if-else statements in many other places. But we won’t worry about this for now, we just want to be aware of the possibility of returning nil and one solution. BENP: this nil redirect aside is also removable, you comment out the code in the video… Back to the view template with our new @the_user object: &lt;!--- app/views/user_templates/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;%= @the_user.username %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;ID&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_user.id %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Edit user&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Form goes here&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“3 7”} We have some progress. Now, what about the “Own photos” section farther down the page? Association accessor methods to the rescue! We have pre-defined a method own_photos in the app/models/user.rb model (go see for yourself). This method returns a list of a given users photos, which we can put in the table (or even call a .count on to get the number of records): &lt;!--- app/views/user_templates/show.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;h2&gt;Own photos (&lt;%= @the_user.own_photos.count %&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Image&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Owner&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Caption&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Posted&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% @the_user.own_photos.each do |a_photo| %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;%= a_photo.image %&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_photo.poster.username %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_photo.caption %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_photo.created_at %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Show details&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“4-23”} These are all the familiar patterns of .each looping over table records and accessing attributes to print in a table (or assign to an HTML tag attribute as in &lt;img src=\"\"&gt;). Note that we could have easily just used the @the_user.username to fill the “Owner” column, because we are on that user’s page. But we showed off another association accessor method, by going from the photo a_photo through the method in the Photo model poster (have a look in app/models/photo.rb and see for yourself), to give us back the user that posted that image, and call username there. As an aside, we generated all this random data with a gem called Faker. Very useful for testing purposes. 30.6.1 Text Companion: User Details show "],["video-segment-adding-navigation-links.html", "30.7 Video Segment: Adding Navigation Links", " 30.7 Video Segment: Adding Navigation Links Notes: time stamp 00:47:40 to 00:50:45 add navbar links to the app/views/layouts/application.html.erb Before we go any further, I want a way to navigate my site by clicking rather than manually entering URLs. Let’s add the navigation links in the page headers like we see on the target for “Users” and “Photos”. To do that we go into our layout view and add it in the &lt;body&gt; tag around where we want the pages to &lt;%= yield %&gt;: &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Photogram GUI&lt;/title&gt; &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt; &lt;!-- Expand the number of characters we can use in the document beyond basic ASCII  --&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Make it responsive to small screens --&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no&quot;&gt; &lt;%= csp_meta_tag %&gt; &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &#39;application&#39;, media: &#39;all&#39; %&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/users&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/photos&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“20-25”} Remember, Rails made this file for you and included all of the HTML header information we discussed early on, so we don’t need to worry about putting this on all of our view templates. Rails gives you a huge head start with this and so many other files that we see in the GitPod workspace. By adding this code to our application layout file, we will see that anywhere we go in our app, the nav bar will follow. 30.7.1 Text Companion: Adding Navigation Links "],["video-segment-users-show-details-link.html", "30.8 Video Segment: Users Show Details Link", " 30.8 Video Segment: Users Show Details Link Notes: time stamp 00:50:45 to 00:52:44 add show details link on /users table with href=\"/users/&lt;%= a_user.username %&gt;\" Let’s go back and make the user “Show details” link on the /users page actually work, so we don’t need to manually enter usernames in our URL path to get to their page. &lt;!--- app/views/user_templates/index.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;% @list_of_users.each do |a_user| %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;%= a_user.id %&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;%= a_user.username %&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/users/&lt;%= a_user.username %&gt;&quot;&gt;Show details&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“15”} And this link will work right away for each user in the table because we defined our dynamic routes, like /users/anisa, /users/austin, etc. So this href=\"\" attribute will lead to a defined route when we click the “Show details” link in our table on /users.

Great, so let’s use that on the @the_photo record that we already have on this page, and fill in the comment attributes (column values) in the loop as well: &lt;!--- app/views/photo_templates/show.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;% @the_photo.comments.each do |a_comment| %&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_comment.commenter.username %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_comment.body %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= a_comment.created_at %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/table&gt; {: mark_lines=“5 7-9”} Note that we are using yet another association accessor method .commenter (you can find that in app/models/comment.rb) on our a_comment variable to get the username (because this method returns a user).

After that, we need to send the user somewhere, and it can’t be back to the photo details page because that photo will be gone. If we look at the target and “View Source”, we will find the structure of this delete link is: href=\"/delete_photo/photo_ID_number\", where photo_ID_number is the photo ID of the photo page we are currently on. This segment of the path will need to be dynamic, like: &lt;!--- app/views/photo_templates/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Photo Details&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;dl&gt; ... &lt;dt&gt;Delete photo&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/delete_photo/&lt;%= @the_photo.id %&gt;&quot;&gt;Delete this photo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; {: mark_lines=“9”} Now this link will not work yet when we click it in our app. “No route matches”, because we haven’t defined the route!

Could this just be skipped as I have it? We have already seen redirect_to, it’s nothing new. We also do the render then redirect_to dance in the Photo Create Form section below, and here I left this in because it is done more concisely. And this is it! .destroy issues the SQL to the database and deletes the record from the table. Try going to a photo details page and clicking on the “Delete this photo” link now. We have just set the action to redirect to the /photos page, but we could have also had this action render another page with some information, like a page that informs the user that the action was successful. Let’s make a /git commit! 30.12.1 Text Companion: Delete Photo Link "],["video-segment-create-photo-form.html", "30.13 Video Segment: Create Photo Form", " 30.13 Video Segment: Create Photo Form Notes: time stamp 01:20:07 to 01:36:27 moving to the C in CRUD build up form in app/views/photo_templates/index.html.erb RCAV action=\"/insert_photo\" with action create fetch params from form, .save to database We’re done with reading and deleting, so now let’s do the trickier ones. Create and update. For create, in the target at /photos, there is a form above the table with all the photos. As an example we can choose a URL, maybe one of the images on the Chicago Booth homepage, like this one. You can right click on any image of your choosing on the page and click on “Copy image address” to get the URL. BENP: might want to change the image in case this URL changes Now we can take our URL back to the target, paste it into the first input on the form, and put some caption in the second input (maybe “UChicago Campus”). For the last input on the form, “Owner ID”, if you put in a user ID that doesn’t exist, like “1”, then it’s not going to add the photo to the table. Why? Because we have a validation on this Photo model: # app/models/photo.rb ... class Photo &lt; ApplicationRecord validates(:poster, { :presence =&gt; true }) def poster my_owner_id = self.owner_id matching_users = User.where({ :id =&gt; my_owner_id }) the_user = matching_users.at(0) return the_user end ... end The association accessor method poster returns a user based on an ID. Above this method, there is a validation associated with it. This is saying that the return of poster (the_user) must be present ({ :presence =&gt; true }), it cannot be nil. BENP: another validation aside, I see it is important now to keep the previous aside So if we try and use a valid “Owner ID” in our add photo form (you can check for a valid user ID in the /users table), then the photo will be added to the top of our /photos index page. Actually, the form takes us directly to the show page for that photo we just added. We need to make this form in our app now. This is standard stuff that we’ve done before for form generation, but the trick now will just be getting the input to save to our database. Try to build the form out for yourself! I’ll wait… BENP: could lnk to active record and forms chapters Let’s work on this together. We need to add a form to our /photos index view template: &lt;!--- app/views/photo_templates/index.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of photos&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;form&gt; &lt;input&gt; &lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;input&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add photo&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;hr&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“5-14”} To give ourselves a little visual space, we added &lt;hr&gt; tags, which stands for “horizontal rule”, and just adds some horizontal lines to bracket the form. The rest is just the skeleton of the &lt;form&gt; we want with two &lt;input&gt;s (no closing tag required), one &lt;textarea&gt;, and a &lt;button&gt;. Let’s add some labels (and some code spacing for readability) to the inputs: &lt;!--- app/views/photo_templates/index.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;form&gt; &lt;label&gt;Image&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input&gt; &lt;label&gt;Caption&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;label&gt;Owner ID&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add photo&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“5 8 11”} We also need to make sure that we tie each label to an input to make the form valid usign for= and id=: &lt;!--- app/views/photo_templates/index.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;form&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;image_box&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;image_box&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;caption_box&quot;&gt;Caption&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea id=&quot;caption_box&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;owner_id_box&quot;&gt;Owner ID&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;owner_id_box&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add photo&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“5-6 8-9 11-12”} If we refresh /photos, we will see that cosmetically the from is already looking good. But it won’t do anything yet. When I click on “Add photo”, I want the form to have an action that points to a new URL, and that URL should call an action that actually takes the input to the form and adds a record to the database. So we need to add an action=\"\" with a URL, and we also need to add a name for each form input, which will go into our query string: &lt;!--- app/views/photo_templates/index.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_photo&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;image_box&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;image_box&quot; name=&quot;query_image&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;caption_box&quot;&gt;Caption&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea id=&quot;caption_box&quot; name=&quot;query_caption&quot; &gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;owner_id_box&quot;&gt;Owner ID&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;owner_id_box&quot; name=&quot;query_owner_id&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add photo&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“4 6 9 12”} Now if you put some input into the form and click “Add button”, then you will be routed to a new URL that begins with /insert_photo?, and has all of your named inputs (query_) and values following the ?. So everything we typed is saved in the query string, and that means it was sent to the params hash, which we can access in our back-end action. We could also add additional attributes to the &lt;input&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt;, like placeholder=\"\" or type=\"\", but that’s up to you. For now the form is functional. Our new URL is getting the “no route matches” error, because we still need to define the route and make the action: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/users&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/users/:path_username&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; }) get(&quot;/photos&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;photos&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/photos/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;photos&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; }) get(&quot;/delete_photo/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;photos&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;delete&quot; })) get(&quot;/insert_photo&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;photos&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; })) end {: mark_lines=“11”} And let’s also define this action that will create the record and redirect the user to the new show page of that photo. At first I’m just going to make a view template to get the action working and rendering some new HTML: # app/controllers/photos_controller.rb class PhotosController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create render({ :template =&gt; &quot;photo_templates/create.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“5-8”} Once we get that page to say “hi” after we click on the “Add photo” button on our new, filled-out form, then we can return to the action and get it to do what we actually want. First we need to go into params and pull out the input from our query string: # app/controllers/photos_controller.rb class PhotosController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create input_image = params.fetch(&quot;query_image&quot;) input_caption = params.fetch(&quot;query_caption&quot;) input_owner_id = params.fetch(&quot;query_owner_id&quot;) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;photo_templates/create.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“6-8”} So how can we save this information into our database? We just need to create a new Photo instance, fill in the attributes, and .save it to issue the SQL and add the record to our table: # app/controllers/photos_controller.rb class PhotosController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create input_image = params.fetch(&quot;query_image&quot;) input_caption = params.fetch(&quot;query_caption&quot;) input_owner_id = params.fetch(&quot;query_owner_id&quot;) new_photo = Photo.new new_photo.image = input_image new_photo.caption = input_caption new_photo.owner_id = input_owner_id new_photo.save render({ :template =&gt; &quot;photo_templates/create.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“10-14”} We can already try and re-submit the form on /photos, and we should be brought again to the create.html.erb template that is just saying “hi”. It’s hard to tell that anything was added to our database, but if we go to our GitPod terminal where bin/server is running and look in the log, then we will see the SQL telling us that our photo was saved. And the new photo was even assigned a unique photo ID that we can use to go directly to (redirect_to) the show page of our new photo: # app/controllers/photos_controller.rb class PhotosController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create input_image = params.fetch(&quot;query_image&quot;) input_caption = params.fetch(&quot;query_caption&quot;) input_owner_id = params.fetch(&quot;query_owner_id&quot;) new_photo = Photo.new new_photo.image = input_image new_photo.caption = input_caption new_photo.owner_id = input_owner_id new_photo.save # render({ :template =&gt; &quot;photo_templates/create.html.erb&quot; }) redirect_to(&quot;/photos/&quot; + new_photo.id.to_s) end end {: mark_lines=“16-17”} Try and add some new URLs to the form on your own and watch it work! Time to /git commit. 30.13.1 Text Companion: Create Photo Form "],["video-segment-update-photo-form.html", "30.14 Video Segment: Update Photo Form", " 30.14 Video Segment: Update Photo Form Notes: time stamp 01:36:27 to 01:50:56 moving to the U in CRUD build up form in app/views/photo_templates/show.html.erb RCAV action=\"/update_photo/&lt;%= @the_photo.id %&gt;\" with action update fetch params from path, .save to database One last thing to do! We did read, we did delete, and we now did create. So it’s time to add an update form to our photo page. Right now we should have: &lt;!--- app/views/photo_templates/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Photo Details&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Image&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;%= @the_photo.image %&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Caption&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_photo.caption %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Owner&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_photo.poster.username %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Posted&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;%= @the_photo.created_at %&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Edit photo&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Form goes here&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Delete photo&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/delete_photo/&lt;%= @the_photo.id %&gt;&quot;&gt;Delete this photo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; ... So everything is working, but we need to zoom in on the &lt;dd&gt;Form goes here&lt;/dd&gt; tag and place a form for updating the photo right there. We can go to a photo details page in our target and save some time by just viewing the page source (right click, “View source”), then copy-pasting the relevant form into our own view template: &lt;!--- app/views/photo_templates/show.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;dt&gt;Edit photo&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/update_photo/777&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_image&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_image&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;input_image&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a URL for the image...&quot; value=&quot;https://robohash.org/dolorehicincidunt.png?size=300x300&amp;amp;set=set1&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_caption&quot;&gt;Caption&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea id=&quot;browser_caption&quot; name=&quot;input_caption&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a caption for the photo...&quot;&gt;Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you.&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;button&gt;Update photo&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/dd&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“5-15”} Now, back in our app, if we visit a photo details page and try to click the “Update photo” link, then we will get a “no route matches” error, because we haven’t defined the action=\"/update_photo/777\", or made it dynamic to change the photo ID in the second segment. Also, we see that there is pre-populated input to the form “Image” and “Caption” fields. These are data taken from our database for whatever image matches the current photo ID (777 in our example). The “Image” field is pre-populated with the value=\"\" attribute to &lt;input&gt;, whereas “Caption” is just pre-populated by placing data between the &lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; tags. (A weird, archaic HTML inconsistency, since &lt;textarea&gt; doesn’t have a value=\"\" attribute available.) This pre-population also needs to be made dynamic, with information taken from the current photo page that we are on. Let’s do all of that using the embedded Ruby tags and instance variables that we have access to on this page! While we’re at it, we will also rename the copy-pasted name attributes after our previous convention using a leading query_ rather than input_: &lt;!--- app/views/photo_templates/show.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;dt&gt;Edit photo&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/update_photo/&lt;%= @the_photo.id %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_image&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_image&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;query_image&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a URL for the image...&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%= @the_photo.image %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_caption&quot;&gt;Caption&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea id=&quot;browser_caption&quot; name=&quot;query_caption&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a caption for the photo...&quot;&gt;&lt;%= @the_photo.caption %&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;button&gt;Update photo&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/dd&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“6 8 11”} Refresh a photo details page in your app, and try to visit other photos as well. You will see the form content dynamically updating on each page. Okay, now we can try to fill out a form, maybe by just changing any given caption to “Caption Updated” in the “Caption” field of the form on one of the photo details pages. And when you click “Update photo”, you still get “no route matches”, but at least you get inputs in the ? query string in the new URL. Let’s RCAV it: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/users&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/users/:path_username&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; }) get(&quot;/photos&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;photos&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/photos/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;photos&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; }) get(&quot;/delete_photo/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;photos&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;delete&quot; })) get(&quot;/insert_photo&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;photos&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; })) get(&quot;/update_photo/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;photos&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;update&quot; })) end {: mark_lines=“12”} # app/controllers/photos_controller.rb class PhotosController &lt; ApplicationController ... def update render({ :template =&gt; &quot;photo_templates/update.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“5-8”} And once we get the form to say “hi” (put that in app/views/photo_templates/update.html.erb), we can get the action to do what we want. First we get the parameters of interest out of the hash, then we find the matching photo with the given ID (part of our dynamic path!), then we update the photo in our database using the form input that we pull from the query string. Additionally, rather than rendering, we will redirect the form back to the current photo page so we can see the update: BENP: at 01:46:00, there is a kinda confusing aside about check boxes and false argument to fetch.. leaving this out # app/controllers/photos_controller.rb class PhotosController &lt; ApplicationController ... def update the_id = params.fetch(&quot;path_id&quot;) the_photo = Photo.where({ :id =&gt; the_id }).first image = params.fetch(&quot;query_image&quot;) caption = params.fetch(&quot;query_caption&quot;) the_photo.caption = caption the_photo.image = image the_photo.save # render({ :template =&gt; &quot;photo_templates/update.html.erb&quot; }) redirect_to(&quot;/photos/&quot; + the_photo.id.to_s) end end {: mark_lines=“6-16”} Try and update some captions on your photos. If you see everything working as you expect, then you can do a rails grade to check your work, and a /git commit. You can now CRUD!

The &lt;label&gt; should have a for=\"\" attribute that matches the id=\"\" attribute of the input.

Let’s look at this controller: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def index ... end def show ... end def create ... end def update ... end end And we see there is no home action defined in our controller. Hence the error message. Let’s look at the target homepage at the URL path /. What is the behavior? It looks like this is just a list of users. And what’s the conventional name for an action that just lists things in a Rails app? index! Back to our controller: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def index matching_users = User.all @users = matching_users.order(:created_at) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;users_templates/all_users.html.erb&quot;}) end ... end {: mark_lines=“5-10”} The first action is the one we want. It returns of an array-like object of all users from the database. Easy fix here is to just go back to our routes and change the name of the action to match our controller: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/users&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;all_users&quot; }) get(&quot;/users/:username&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;user&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; }) get(&quot;/insert_user_record&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;venues&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; }) get(&quot;/update_users/:user_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;update&quot; }) ... end {: mark_lines=“5”} Now back in your app browser, refresh /.

This error page could be introduced elsewhere, earlier in the class I want to point out the error page in our Rails app. We see the error message, but we also see that the specific line of code in our codebase that is causing the error is also shown. I want to emphasize, in this better_errors page, which is a third-party gem that does not come by default with Rails, there is a super useful REPL (Rails console) below the highlighted code error. If you ever need to, you can look at any instance variables or params right from this terminal. The REPL is frozen in time right where that error occurred. So it’s a very useful playground for you find a solution and debug right on this page before you go and change things in the codebase.

Back to the current error message on /: Missing template users_templates/all_users.html.erb Let’s look in our folder on GitPod for this file. We see right away when we take a look for it that the folder is called user_templates/, whereas we have in our action users_templates/, with an extra s after user. We could change the foldername, or we could change the path for the rendered template in our action. So far our convention has been to use the singular name of the record, so we will change the index action to render({ :template =&gt; \"user_templates/all_users.html.erb\"}). Now when we refresh / in our app’s browser, the page loads without an error. If for some reason you still have an error on the page, you may need to close down the server terminal, and restart it. This is just a bug in GitPod BENP: is this still a bug?. And remember, the database in our new app is empty, so that’s why you may not see any records in your “List of users”. We need to run rails sample_data in a terminal on GitPod to get some toy data. BENP: 00:08:30 to 00:10:55 had to deal with project bug, showing that faker is missing from the gem file.

We are trying to get to a venue details page, like in our target. We get a “no route matches” error. Based on the developer conventions from the Rails community, we were expecting the list of things we are interested in (the index action) to be on a URL with the plural name of the thing of interest, in this case /venues. Also, for the individual venue, it is typical to put the details page at /venues/[ID of venue]. In this case, we tried to get to the details page of the venue from our venues table with the id column value of “1”. We could have named these routes anything we want, like /venue_details. But we don’t because it is usually good to follow conventions. Back to the error, let’s check our route: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/users&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;all_users&quot; }) get(&quot;/users/:username&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;user&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; }) get(&quot;/insert_user_record&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;venues&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; }) get(&quot;/update_users/:user_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;update&quot; }) get(&quot;/venues&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;venues&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/insert_venue_record&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;venues&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; }) get(&quot;/venue/:an_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;venue&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; }) post(&quot;/update_venue/:the_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;update&quot; }) get(&quot;/delete_venue/:id_to_delete&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;venue&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;destroy&quot; }) get(&quot;/insert_comment_record&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;comments&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“13”} Right away, we can spot that the path and controller \"venue\" should say \"venues\" to match the controller file app/controllers/venues_controller.rb, which is, again by convention, the plural snake_case name of the table. Change these both to \"venues\", and refresh /venues/1. A new error: param is missing or the value is empty: venue_id In the error page, we see the highlighted code is in the app/controllers/venue_controllers.rb file in the show action in the first line: # app/controllers/venue_controllers.rb class VenuesController &lt; ApplicationController ... def show venue_id = params.fetch(&quot;venue_id&quot;) matching_venues = Venue.where({ :id =&gt; venue_id }) the_venue = matching_venues render({ :template =&gt; &quot;venue_templates/details.html.erb&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“6”} On the error page you can also note that I have the “Request Info” section of the page, where it actually shows me my “Request parameters” hash. We see that in our action we are trying to look up the venue_id from params, but in our params hash (which we can also have a look at in the error page REPL), we have this key as an_id. This is the name we gave it up in our config/routes.rb file, so we can change the name there or in the action: # app/controllers/venue_controllers.rb class VenuesController &lt; ApplicationController ... def show venue_id = params.fetch(&quot;an_id&quot;) matching_venues = Venue.where({ :id =&gt; venue_id }) the_venue = matching_venues render({ :template =&gt; &quot;venue_templates/details.html.erb&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“6”} And once we have the correct parameter, we can refresh /venues/1, and get another error: undefined method `address&#39; for nil:NilClass It is common to stop after you get to undefined method and go searching for this missing method. But you need to Read The whole Error Message. We can see that the highlighted code where the error occurred is in views/venue_templates/details.html.erb where we try and do @the_venue.address. The problem is that we are calling .address on a nil object. What is the nil object? @the_venue! In our error page REPL, if we type &gt;&gt; @the_venue, indeed we will see the return =&gt; nil. We expected an instance of Venue from our venues table here. Let’s start by looking at our show action above. We are taking an ID from the path (here “1”): venue_id = params.fetch(\"an_id\"). Then we are looking up the matching venues from the table: matching_venues = Venue.where({ :id =&gt; venue_id }). We can see how this looks by going back to our error page REPL and entering &gt;&gt; Venue.where({ :id =&gt; 1 }). And we will see that this returns an ActiveRecord::Relation with one venue in it. Now we want to get just the first venue, because we only want one result and we don’t want the full array-like ActiveRecord::Relation. Right away we see the two errors: we need to call .at(0) or .first, and we also need to make the action variable an instance variable so we can access it in our view template: # app/controllers/venue_controllers.rb class VenuesController &lt; ApplicationController ... def show venue_id = params.fetch(&quot;an_id&quot;) matching_venues = Venue.where({ :id =&gt; venue_id }) @the_venue = matching_venues.at(0) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;venue_templates/details.html.erb&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“8”} This was tricky, because with instance variables in Ruby, there is no error if the instance variable doesn’t exist. It just returns a nil object. Then when we try and call our defined methods on that object, we begin to get error messages. But the error is not with the methods, but rather with the object they are being called on. If we refresh /venues/1 and get another error message: undefined method `address&#39; for #&lt;Venue:ActiveRecord_Relation:...&gt; again, don’t stop reading after undefined method 'address'. We can now see that the venue object is being returned, so that’s good. But the .address is undefined. But that’s because we are not returning a single instance of Venue, we are getting an ActiveRecord::Relation **BENP: okay, I have been writing :: everywhere, but in the error message it is _, which is correct?**. That means we are trying to call .address on an array-like object, and we forgot the .at(0) in our show action above. 32.2.1 Text Companion: Typos and NilClass Bug "],["video-segment-association-accessor-self.id-bug.html", "32.3 Video Segment: Association Accessor self.id Bug", " 32.3 Video Segment: Association Accessor self.id Bug -Notes: time stamp 00:17:47 to 00:28:35 RTEM to continue debugging /venues/[ID of venue] tricky bug: self.id in Comment#commenter, rather than self.author_id Now, assuming the show bugs have been dealt with, if we refresh /venues/1, then we get the error: undefined method `username&#39; for nil:NilClass And we see the highlighted code in the view template is coming where we try to call comment.commenter.username. From our experience, we know that the comment.commenter is somehow nil. Above this, we see that we are calling .comments on our @the_venue object in order to get a list of comments for looping over and displaying: @the_venue.comments.each do |comment|. Because the .each call didn’t throw an error, we can assume that the .comments method is returning an array-like object ActiveRecord::Relation of the comments associated with that venue ID. But inside of this loop, the comment, or the .commenter method called on it, is nil. Let’s check in our error page REPL. We can start with just &gt;&gt; @the_venue, which should return our instance of Venue. Then we can try &gt;&gt; @the_venue.comments, which should return an array-like object full of comments that match the venue. Good. But where is this .comments method from? It is in the model! Any method that we call on a class from our database is defined in the class file. Let’s go look at that First, in order to get from a Venue to a Comment, we can look at the Comment model to remind us of the names of the columns: # app/models/comment.rb # == Schema Information # # Table name: comments # # id :integer not null, primary key # body :string # created_at :datetime not null # updated_at :datetime not null # author_id :integer # venue_id :integer # ... {: mark_lines=“12”} In the # == Schema Information we see there is a foreign key column called venue_id. So we want to find all of the comments where ID in this column matches my current venue of interest. In the Venue model, we find: # app/models/venue.rb # == Schema Information # # Table name: venues # # id :integer not null, primary key # address :string # name :string # neighborhood :string # created_at :datetime not null # updated_at :datetime not null # class Venue &lt; ApplicationRecord def comments my_id = self.id matching_comments = Comment.where({ :venue_id =&gt; my_id }) return matching_comments end end {: mark_lines=“17-21”} This comments method in an association accessor method. It first says, get the current venue ID (our @the_venue instance variable) using the self.id call. It then searches the venue_id column of the Comment model (which accesses the comments table) for my current ID, and then it returns all of these matching rows. So it looks like in our view template the comments method should be doing the right thing. And we saw this was the case in our error page REPL when we typed &gt;&gt; @the_venue.comments. It returned an array-like object full of comments that match the venue. That brings us to the block variable comment in our .each loop. At the error page REPL, type &gt;&gt; comment. Indeed a single Comment object is return, which is a row from the table comments in our database. Now at the REPL try: &gt;&gt; comment.commenter. It gives us =&gt; nil! How could we replace our code and manually traverse from the comment to the username associated with that comment? If we look at our Comment instance, we can see there is a foreign key column called author_id with a value of “96”. This is the key that we can use in User to look up which user authored a given comment. To write this out: User.where({ :id =&gt; 96 }). Then we can .at(0) and .username on that to get the name we want. At the REPL: &gt;&gt; User.where({ :id =&gt; 96 }).at(0).username should return =&gt; \"jolie\" BENP: are the returns consistent with faker? will it always be “jolie”. So this does work. We can traverse manually to get the username, and comment.commenter is not failing and returning nil because there is no username. This is something you need to start to consider. There may be entries that do have nil values in a given column. Some bugs can be caused by invalid data and not problems in our code. However, here we saw the bug was not caused by invalid data. That means we need to go look in the Comment model at the .commenter method: # app/models/comment.rb # == Schema Information # # Table name: comments # # id :integer not null, primary key # body :string # created_at :datetime not null # updated_at :datetime not null # author_id :integer # venue_id :integer # class Comment &lt; ApplicationRecord def commenter my_id = self.id matching_users = User.where({ :id =&gt; my_id }) the_user = matching_users.at(0) return the_user end end {: mark_lines=“16-21”} BENP: on https://github.com/appdev-projects/very-best-debug/blob/master/app/models/comment.rb the line already is corrected and says my_id = self.author_id. I changed it above to match the video We are taking the self.id! But what we want is the author_id foreign key column not the primary key of the given comment. So change the line to my_id = self.author_id, and refresh /venues/1 once more in our browser.

Note: rails g is short for rails generate, like c is for console and s is for server. As usual, we have to run the command rails db:migrate at a Terminal prompt to execute the migrations that were written for us by the generator, to actually create the new table. 34.2.1 What just happened? Whoa, what just happened?

A controller named after the table. Some view templates related to the table. Some routes related to the table. If you look at the routes, controller, and views, you’ll see that it has essentially added in all of the standard CRUD boilerplate for us — automatically! Try navigating to /photos, or whatever your table is called, and you’ll see that you have a fully-functional interface to CRUD records. Awesome! This makes sense because, as you might have noticed by now, the Golden Five RCAVs relating to letting users Create, Read, Update, and Delete records through their browser are basically the same for every table; only the form inputs vary, really, based on the different columns in the tables. And since we’re going to need most of the Golden Five for most of our tables, why not automate the boilerplate? Then we can just delete the stuff that we don’t want, and modify what’s left to match our needs. Whew! What a time saver. However, it only saves time if you are comfortable with all of the code that it is writing for you — otherwise the code is intimidating and you are scared to change it. Then, rather than saving you time, the generators slow you down; relative to you writing code by hand that you understand . So choose your approach wisely. When in doubt, pick a URL that you want the user to be able to visit, connect the RCAV dots yourself, and make it happen.

Let’s take a look at two side-by-side: Character#movie and Movie#director: # app/models/character.rb # == Schema Information # # Table name: characters # # id :integer not null, primary key # name :string # created_at :datetime not null # updated_at :datetime not null # actor_id :integer # movie_id :integer # class Character &lt; ApplicationRecord def movie key = self.movie_id matching_set = Movie.where({ :id =&gt; key }) the_one = matching_set.at(0) return the_one end end # app/models/movie.rb # == Schema Information # # Table name: movies # # id :integer not null, primary key # description :text # duration :integer # image :string # title :string # year :integer # created_at :datetime not null # updated_at :datetime not null # director_id :integer # class Movie &lt; ApplicationRecord def director key = self.director_id matching_set = Director.where({ :id =&gt; key }) the_one = matching_set.at(0) return the_one end end Both of these methods are from a 1-N association and represent going from the “many” back over to the “one” that it belongs to. If I am a Movie, I contain a foreign key, the director_id column, and I want to take that value, go to the ID column of Director, find the matching record, and return it. The same goes for Character#movie. All of our association accessor methods follow the same pattern! What if we want to define the Character#actor 1-N association? # app/models/character.rb ... class Character &lt; ApplicationRecord def movie key = self.movie_id matching_set = Movie.where({ :id =&gt; key }) the_one = matching_set.at(0) return the_one end def actor key = self.actor_id matching_set = Actor.where({ :id =&gt; key }) the_one = matching_set.at(0) return the_one end end {: mark_lines=“15-23”} Compare the movie and actor method. They are almost identical with just a difference in a few names. Defining association accessor methods is incredibely important for a good, maintainable code base. And, because of how formulaic this is, Rails makes it easy to automate! The “Pit of Success” of Rails! BENP: link or define pit of success There are three things that changed between movie and actor: the name of the method, the name of the foreign key column, and the name of the class that we search in. There’s a meta method called belongs_to(), which can be used outside of the method definitions directly in the model. This method will define our association accessor for us if we give it just three arguments: # app/models/character.rb ... class Character &lt; ApplicationRecord belongs_to(:name_that_we_want, { :class_name =&gt; &quot;&quot;, :foreign_key =&gt; &quot;&quot; }) def movie key = self.movie_id matching_set = Movie.where({ :id =&gt; key }) the_one = matching_set.at(0) return the_one end ... end {: mark_lines=“5”} The first argument is the name of the method we want, then a hash with two key/value pairs containing the name of the class and the foreign key. So if we want a method .movie that we can call on Character, we can just write (and comment out or delete our old code): # app/models/character.rb ... class Character &lt; ApplicationRecord belongs_to(:movie, { :class_name =&gt; &quot;Movie&quot;, :foreign_key =&gt; &quot;movie_id&quot; }) # def movie # key = self.movie_id # matching_set = Movie.where({ :id =&gt; key }) # the_one = matching_set.at(0) # return the_one # end ... end {: mark_lines=“5”} Try this out. Comment or delete the def movie section of the model once you have the belongs_to() filled out. Visit in your app browser an actor details page (did you run rails sample_data yet?). For instance /actors/343. Now if we scroll down to the “Filmography” table, there is a column showing the character name in each movie for the given actor. So everything is still working even though we deleted our previous association accessor method! BENP: Why belongs_to is Better, starting below, from: 01:01:06 to 01:09:14 The def movie that we wrote out line-by-line and the new belongs_to version are producing the same thing. But belongs_to is somewhat shorter, and it reads better (is easier to understand at a glance). Moreover, we can look at an example in our Rails console for why this technique is so good. Open a rails console. What if we asked for all of the characters from movies that are newer than 1994? Until today we couldn’t do that! We can use a new method called .joins, which you give the name of an association that you declared with belongs_to (it must be declared this way for .joins to work). Then you can use .where and the association accessor with another hash that searches over a specific range specified by another column: pry(main)&gt; Character.joins(:movie).where(&quot;movies.year &gt; 1994&quot;) Note here that when using joins, where takes its argument as a string rather than a hash. That will return an ActiveRecord::Relation with all of the movies of interest. It is very common to query one table with the columns of another. And if we look at the SQL issued by the relatively simple Ruby command above, then we see it is getting pretty tricky to write, and ActiveRecord just does that for us. Yet another reason that belongs_to is great, is that we can write: belongs_to(:movie, { :class_name =&gt; &quot;Movie&quot;, :foreign_key =&gt; &quot;movie_id&quot; }) as simply belongs_to(:movie) We can delete most of the code because the method belongs_to will follow a well defined pattern of naming! So as long as the function, table, and foreign key columns share the same name (with only capitalization difference), then we can write a very short, explicit, and clear association accessor method. If you prefer to write out the entire thing, you are welcome to, but this is just another shortcut in your toolbox. 35.1.1 Text Companion: belongs_to "],["video-segment-has_many.html", "35.2 Video Segment: has_many", " 35.2 Video Segment: has_many Notes: time stamp 01:09:14 to 01:13:08 refactor 1-N Movie#characters, going from the “one” to the “many” aside into method syntax for Director#filmography 35.2.1 Text Companion: has_many As opposed to belongs_to(:movie) in Character (Character#movie), we also want to have a Movie#characters method, which is the other side of the relationship, the many to the one. We could define this ourselves like so: # app/models/movie.rb ... class Movie &lt; ApplicationRecord def characters key = self.id the_many = Character.where( {:movie_id =&gt; key }) return the_many end def director key = self.director_id matching_set = Director.where({ :id =&gt; key }) the_one = matching_set.at(0) return the_one end end {: mark_lines=“5-9”} This is a different method compared to the one to the many. Of course, the director method could already be replaced with just belongs_to(:director)! But how can we replace def characters? belongs_to(:characters) won’t work, that will write the wrong method in this case, because our new method does not follow the expected pattern for a one to a many. We need to use the method has_many, which has a similar form: # app/models/movie.rb ... class Movie &lt; ApplicationRecord belongs_to(:director) has_many(:characters, { :class_name =&gt; &quot;Character&quot;, :foreign_key =&gt; &quot;character_id&quot; }) # def characters # key = self.id # the_many = Character.where( {:movie_id =&gt; key }) # return the_many # end ... end {: mark_lines=“6-7”} All we did was provide the method with the three pieces of information that we expect to vary: the name of the method, name of the class, and name of the foreign key. And then has_many writes an association accessor method for us of the form that we put together in def characters. Similar to belongs_to, if the three arguments match, we can write: has_many(:characters, { :class_name =&gt; &quot;Character&quot;, :foreign_key =&gt; &quot;character_id&quot; }) as simply has_many(:characters) This shortcut only works if the names match! For instance, in our Director class, we have an association accessor method called filmography. We could have called this movies, which would have allowed us to write has_many(:movies), but if we wrote has_many(:filmography), then Rails would look for a class called Filmography, and a foreign key column called filmography_id, neither of which exist! So in the case where we selected our own, non-conventional names, then we need to be explicit and write: has_many(:filmography, { :class_name =&gt; &quot;Movie&quot; }) We can still omit the foreign key, because now the method will know to call the foreign key movie_id based on the :class_name.

These values are being stored by Chrome on your own laptop, so they are unique to each of us on different computers! We can see the “Name” column and the “Value” column with things related to our addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These are key/value pairs, just like the hashes that we are used to. Each domain is able to store about 50 key/value pairs, with some slight variation in the amount by browser (e.g., Chrome vs. Firefox), and use about 4 kb of space. That’s not much space, but plenty for some basic text information. What if I select a row from my cookies table and delete it? When I go back to the form associated with that cookie, the memory of the key/value pair I entered will be erased. It resets the memory. Useful if you ever want to force signout of a website (using the “Clear all cookies” button). 37.1.1 Text Companion: Exploring Browser Cookies "],["video-segment-cookies-object.html", "37.2 Video Segment: cookies Object", " 37.2 Video Segment: cookies Object Notes: time stamp 00:03:30 to 00:10:23 explore &lt;%= cookies %&gt; on app/views/calculation_templates/addition_form.html.erb cookies.store() in add action and show in view template Let’s see how to implement this in our Rails app. If we open our app browser and try some of the calculation forms and go back, we will see there is no memory of my previous interaction being shown. First, let’s find the form we want to work on. How about addition? We can begin by embedding a variable called cookies, that we haven’t discussed yet. Rails creates this and gives it to us, just like params. It comes pre-defined for us and puts it into this hash-like object: &lt;!--- app/views/calculation_templates/addition_form.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;New addition&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/wizard_add&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;first_field&quot;&gt;Add this:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;first_field&quot; name=&quot;first_num&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;second_field&quot;&gt;to this:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;second_field&quot; name=&quot;second_num&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;%= cookies %&gt; {: mark_lines=“15”} Now we can refresh the “Add” page (at the URL path /muggle_add), and we will see that where we embedded cookies there is a an ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieJar class. This object behaves just like a hash. So we can do things like .fetch() and .store() key/value pairs in it. If we wanted to store some random pair like apple (key) and banana (value), we could write &lt;%= cookies.store(:apple, \"banana\") %&gt;. If we refresh /muggle_add, then open the dev tools and go to our “Application” tab and then the cookies for the current domain, we will see the “Name” and “Value” column have been added to with “apple” and “banana”, respectively. So this information is now stored in the browser on my laptop. And we could go and .fetch it from cookies elsewhere in the app! But let’s do something more interesting. Let’s store the results of each addition. We know from our addition form, that the action=\"/wizard_add\" is telling us that this is the route the form will send the input to. That route goes to the app/controllers/calculations_controller.rb action called add (check the config/routes.rb file to see that). This is the action that actually parses information from the query string (supplied by the form), does the calculation and renders a template showing the result. Let’s improve this action by also storing the results in our cookies object: # app/controllers/calculations_controller.rb class CalculationsController &lt; ApplicationController ... def add @first_number = params.fetch(&quot;first_num&quot;).to_f @second_number = params.fetch(&quot;second_num&quot;).to_f @result = @first_number.to_f + @second_number.to_f cookies.store(:addition_result, @result) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/add_results.html.erb&quot; }) end ... {:mark_lines=“11”} Now that we stored it in the cookies hash, if we go back to /muggle_add, and (with our dev tools cookies tab open!) input some data and click “Add!”, then we will see a new “Name”/“Value” pair appear in our table, the “addition_result” with our @result value from the action. And now, back in the form, we can embed the new cookies value using the key that we assigned to it in the action: &lt;!--- app/views/calculation_templates/addition_form.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;New addition&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/wizard_add&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;first_field&quot;&gt;Add this:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;first_field&quot; name=&quot;first_num&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;second_field&quot;&gt;to this:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;second_field&quot; name=&quot;second_num&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your previous addition was: &lt;%= cookies.fetch(:addition_result) %&gt;&lt;/p&gt; {: mark_lines=“15”} And now if we enter data in the form, click “Add!”, view the results, and then return to /muggle_add, we will see the result of our previous calculation being displayed. We can expand this to match the target by storing the other two numbers and displaying the full calculation string on the addition page: # app/controllers/calculations_controller.rb class CalculationsController &lt; ApplicationController ... def add @first_number = params.fetch(&quot;first_num&quot;).to_f @second_number = params.fetch(&quot;second_num&quot;).to_f @result = @first_number.to_f + @second_number.to_f cookies.store(:addition_result, @result) cookies.store(:addition_first, @first_number) cookies.store(:addition_second, @second_number) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;calculation_templates/add_results.html.erb&quot; }) end ... {:mark_lines=“12-13”} &lt;!--- app/views/calculation_templates/addition_form.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;New addition&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/wizard_add&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;first_field&quot;&gt;Add this:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;first_field&quot; name=&quot;first_num&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;second_field&quot;&gt;to this:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;second_field&quot; name=&quot;second_num&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your previous addition was: &lt;%= cookies.fetch(:addition_first) %&gt; + &lt;%= cookies.fetch(:addition_second) %&gt; = &lt;%= cookies.fetch(:addition_result) %&gt; &lt;/p&gt; {: mark_lines=“15-20”} Now the page /muggle_add should match the target. That’s fundamentally it for cookies! Just a simple key/value object called cookies that we can add to and pull values out of in any action and any view template. The cookies that a user stores on their computer will come back to us everytime they visit our app from the same browser and we can fetch to show the user tailored content. Until they clear their cookies, use a new browser, or use a new computer. 37.2.1 Text Companion: cookies Object "],["finish-and-submit-cookies-intro.html", "37.3 Finish and Submit Cookies Intro", " 37.3 Finish and Submit Cookies Intro see cookies.md for requirements "],["photogram-signin-intro-to-authentication.html", "38 Photogram Signin (Intro to Authentication)", " 38 Photogram Signin (Intro to Authentication) Notes: Cookies Intro video transcription is in photogram-signin.md Project (graded): https://github.com/appdev-projects/photogram-signin Target: https://photogram-signin.matchthetarget.com/ Useful chapters: cookies-vs-session.md BENP: signin vs. sign in vs. sign-in (same for signup, signout, signon, etc.), decide and check doc for consistency BENP: there are no /git commits done in the original video until around 50min when there is all of a sudden an intro to git including branching.

This is just being added on top of the Photogram GUI project that we already finished, so, as usual, the starting point of our app is the finishing point of that project. Be sure to run rails sample_data in case your /users homepage is empty when you open the app browser. We’re pretty familiar with the app by now, with it’s list of users, list of photos, and details pages, including photo comments. Right now, when we add a comment, we need to include a valid author ID in the form to get it to work. We’re finally going to evolve this to what it should be. When a user signs up, there there will be an ID number assigned, but they won’t see it, and when a user uploads a photo that photo will be associated with them by the ID numbers. Let’s start to evolve this step-by-step. 38.1.1 Text Companion: Intro and Exploring Our Starting Point "],["video-segment-storing-passwords.html", "38.2 Video Segment: Storing Passwords", " 38.2 Video Segment: Storing Passwords Notes: time stamp 00:02:00 to 00:08:39 migration file: rails g migration AddPasswordDigestToUsers add password_digest Column to User explore db/migrate and rails db:migrate add has_secure_password to app/models/user.rb to get .password and .password_confirmation bcrypt gem First of all, we want to make it so that there is an actual signup page, rather than just the current “Add user” form at the top of the list of users. What we want is for a route like /user_sign_up to exist. Try entering that in your app’s browser, get the familiar error message, and begin debugging. But first, what do we want here? We want this new route to display a form and for that form to have fields for username and password. Now we need a new column that will contain something related to a password. In our domain modeling in class, when we created this column for our users table, we chose to name it “password”. That’s a good first instinct, but it’s not a good idea to store our user’s passwords in plain text in our database. If our database is compromised (e.g., hacked), then anyone can see them. What we do instead is scramble up a user’s password in a deterministic way, so that we can always scramble them in the same way, but it’s hard to go in the opposite direction. This is known as a oneway hashing algorithm. Basically, whatever the user says their password is, we don’t store it, but we are able to authenticate it. “Password digest” is the name that we choose for this scrambled-password column. So we just need to add this column to our users table, which already exists in our project. BENP: at this point in video we use active record chapter as reference to steps We can add a column using our reference. First we need a migration file, just the file because we already have the model. Then we can write a method in there to add or remove a column. At the terminal in our GitPod app, we can first do: rails g migration AddPasswordDigestToUsers Running that just creates a file in the db/migrate/ GitPod workspace folder for me, and gives the file the correct name, like: db/migrate/[TIME OF GENERATION]_add_password_digest_to_users.rb. The timestamp in the filename is important, because this orders the filenames correctly in the db/migrate/ folder. Once we push this code to our production server and run rails db:migrate, it needs to run the migrations in order. For instance, we want the user table to be generated before we try to add a column to it! Now we have this migration file, but we need to add our instructions on how we want to evolve the database. Let’s do that: # db/migrate/[TIME OF GENERATION]_add_password_digest_to_users.rb class AddPasswordDigestToUsers &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0] def change add_column :users, :password_digest, :string end end {: mark_lines=“5”} The add_column method is saying, create a new column in the users table with the name password_digest and make this column of type string. We could add additional changes of adding or dropping lines on this table or others all within the def change method, but it’s often better to keep the changes in their own respective files, with appropriate filenames. Back at the terminal prompt, we can push our changes to the database by running: rails db:migrate And this command will look in the db/migrate/ folder and see which have files have been run, and which have not been, and it will only run the latter. With that command, we now have added the password_digest column to our app/models/user.rb model (check the # == Schema Information to see the added column). Now we’re ready to store a password in a secure manner. With these steps, we have automatically added two attributes on User: .password and .password_confirmation. So we can call those two methods as if they were columns (even though they are not!), and Rails will make sure they match then scramble the password securely, and store them as a string in the password_digest column. We just need to make one addition to the model: # app/models/user.rb ... class User &lt; ApplicationRecord validates(:username, { :presence =&gt; true, :uniqueness =&gt; { :case_sensitive =&gt; false }, }) has_secure_password def comments ... end ... end {: mark_lines=“11”} This declaration in our active record model, is actually coming from the Gemfile in our GitPod root folder. We haven’t discussed the Gemfile much BENP: see notes in previous videos, it has been brought up a bit, might need early dedicated information, but it’s very important. It contains a list of all the libraries that our application is relying on, including Rails itself: # Gemfile source &#39;https://rubygems.org&#39; git_source(:github) { |repo| &quot;https://github.com/#{repo}.git&quot; } ruby &#39;2.7.3&#39; # Bundle edge Rails instead: gem &#39;rails&#39;, github: &#39;rails/rails&#39; gem &#39;rails&#39;, &#39;~&gt; 6.0.3&#39;, &#39;&gt;= 6.0.3.2&#39; # Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record # Use Puma as the app server gem &#39;puma&#39;, &#39;~&gt; 4.1&#39; # Use Active Model has_secure_password gem &#39;bcrypt&#39; ... {: mark_lines=“9 16”} gem is Ruby’s name for libraries that we are borrowing from other people, 'rails' being the motherload. One of these gems is also called 'bcrypt', and that’s where we’re getting the has_secure_password method from, which automatically defines the .password and .password_confirmation methods, and scrambles the input password, if you have a column named password_digest. 38.2.1 Text Companion: Storing Passwords "],["video-segment-signup-form.html", "38.3 Video Segment: Signup Form", " 38.3 Video Segment: Signup Form Notes: time stamp 00:08:39 to 00:24:51 add navigation links in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb RCAV /user_sign_up copy and modify add user form found in app/views/users/index.html.erb use type=\"password\" inputs fix create action to use .password and .password_confirmation before .save control flow with :notice or :alert Now we are ready to get /user_sign_up working. This is just a regular CRUD task. BENP: 00:08:40 to 00:09:40 was kind of a flub, deleted this bit of transcription. Let’s follow the usual RCAV, by first defining the route: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;new_registration_form&quot; }) ... end {: mark_lines=7\"} Then defining the action: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def new_registration_form render({ :template =&gt; &quot;users/signup_form.html.erb&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“4-6”} And get that view template doing something: &lt;!--- app/views/users/signup_form.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;hi&lt;/h1&gt; Once we have the page working, we’re ready to add a form. Since this is the Photogram project, we actually have form that we can pull from on the index users action view template (app/views/users/index.html.erb), where we had the “Add user” form at the top of the page. So let’s just cut (because we don’t want this form here anymore!) and paste from app/views/users/index.html.erb into our new view template for modification: &lt;!--- app/views/users/signup_form.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_user_record&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_username&quot;&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_username&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;input_username&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a username...&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Sign up!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“3-10”} This form also has an action associated with it, that is going to do exactly what we want! That’s because we already designed the CRUD steps in our Photogram project. Here we want to create a user in our database, and we can see in our routes and controller file, that these steps are ready for us: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;new_registration_form&quot; }) # User routes # CREATE get(&quot;/insert_user_record&quot;, {:controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; }) ... end {: mark_lines=“12”} BENP: navbar aside Before we go any farther, let’s add a link to our view template that will get us to the signup form without needing to enter the URL. We can do this by just adding a link in our navbar in the app/views/layouts/application.html.erb wrapper file: &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/users&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/photos&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“10-16”} BENP: beware, the navbar comes empty in the current github project: https://github.com/appdev-projects/photogram-signin/blob/master/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb (but was already filled with some links in this video). Layout page comes up a lot below, so check all of these for consistency. Okay, now in our signup form we still need to modify the form to include password fields: &lt;!--- app/views/users/signup_form.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_user_record&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_username&quot;&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_username&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;input_username&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a username...&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_password&quot;&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_password&quot; type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;input_password&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a password...&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_password_confirmation&quot;&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_password_confirmation&quot; type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;input_password_confirmation&quot; placeholder=&quot;Confirm your password...&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Sign up!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“9-10 12-13”} Note that we changed the type=\"\" attribute from \"text\" to \"password\" so the user’s input is hidden on screen when they fill out the form. And becasue we want the user to be sure of the hidden password, we have them confirm it in the last field. So the /user_sign_up is looking like the target now, with the correct form. If we fill out the form with a new user and password, and click “Sign up!”, then it should call the action create in the controller users_controller.rb, as defined by the action=\"/insert_user_record\" route. This action looks like: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create user = User.new user.username = params.fetch(&quot;input_username&quot;) user.save redirect_to(&quot;/users/#{user.username}&quot;) end ... end We instantiate a new record, fill in the username, then save the record. We are missing a password here! But does the form work as it is and add a username to the database anyway? Clear the server log in the terminal running bin/server, try to create a new user and password, and click “Sign up!”. We get an error! We do end up on the details pages at least /users/[NEW USER], but I get the error: undefined method `username&#39; for nil:NilClass And this error was occurring when, in the user details view template, we got to: &lt;h1&gt;&lt;%= @user.username %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;. So @user is nil, which means that in the show action when we looked up a username like: User.where({ :username =&gt; the_username }).at(0), I got nothing back, because there is no user in my database with the username in in the second segment of our path! In other words, the new user is not being added to the database with our sign up form. The validation failed, and if we look in the app/controllers/users_controller.rb file, then we see the only validation is for a username being present and unique. But we also put in the has_secure_password declaration. And this is the line that is preventing the user from being added without a password! Let’s fix our create action. The .save method returns true (if it worked) or false (if it didn’t), so we can store that in a variable and use it to decide the next step in a conditional. To give the user more information about what is going on, we can also use the notice and alert feature, as a second argument to redirect_to. Remember, when the save doesn’t work there is the collection called user.errors.full_messages, which is an array containing everything that went wrong. BENP: when was notice and alert introduced? Could link to here But, most importantly, we need to assign a password field to our new user with our new User methods .password and .password_confirmation: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create user = User.new user.username = params.fetch(&quot;input_username&quot;) user.password = params.fetch(&quot;input_password&quot;) user.password_confirmation = params.fetch(&quot;input_password_confirmation&quot;) save_status = user.save if save_status == true redirect_to(&quot;/users/#{user.username}&quot;, { :notice =&gt; &quot;Welcome, #{user.username}!&quot;}) else redirect_to(&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;, { :alert =&gt; user.errors.full_messages.to_sentence }) end end ... end {: mark_lines=“9-10 12 14-18”} Remember .password and .password_confirmation are not columns in our table (we only added password_digest). Again, this is because of has_secure_password is doing all of the work of adding these attributes but keeping them hidden and safe (thanks to the bcrypt gem). Now, if the save doesn’t work the user will be redirected back to the form, and if it does work the user will be shown a confirmation message. Before testing, we need to add the notice and alert messages to our show and signup pages (where they are sent): &lt;!--- app/views/users/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;%= notice %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;%= @user.username %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“3-5”} &lt;!--- app/views/users/signup_form.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;%= alert %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Sign Up&lt;/h1&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“3-5”} With all of this done, we can visit /user_sign_up (you can also use the link in our navbar to get there), and test add some new users. Try to add the user with a valid password (takes you to the user details page with the welcome message), and without a valid password (you stay on the form and get an error message detailing what you did wrong). It looks like everything is working! 38.3.1 Text Companion: Signup Form "],["video-segment-notices-and-alerts.html", "38.4 Video Segment: Notices and Alerts", " 38.4 Video Segment: Notices and Alerts Notes: time stamp 00:24:51 to 00:30:21 add notice and alert to app/views/layouts/application.html.erb use if ... present? control flow and style green and red Generally speaking, on every page in the application we are going to want to have the option of showing notices and alerts, so let’s just remove those from the show and signup view templates and put them in my application layout view template: &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;nav&gt; ... &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;%= notice %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;%= alert %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“14-20”} Now these alert and notice messages will appear on any page. Maybe we want to style them a bit though, to make them somewhat more prominent with red and green boxes and text: &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;nav&gt; ... &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;border: thin green solid; color: green;&quot;&gt; &lt;%= notice %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;border: thin red solid; color: red;&quot;&gt; &lt;%= alert %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“14 18”} But if we try to use our pages now, we will see the empty box appearing even when ther is not message. So we need to further modify the code to only show the box if a notice or alert is present: &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;nav&gt; ... &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;% if notice.present? %&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;border: thin green solid; color: green;&quot;&gt; &lt;%= notice %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;% if alert.present? %&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;border: thin red solid; color: red;&quot;&gt; &lt;%= alert %&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“14 18 20 24”} This type of conditional is something you write a lot of in your view templates, so get used to it! Once you have a user, you need conditionals to show or not show them content based on who they are and what their privilege levels are. We are using .present?, which is similar to other ways of doing this, like writing != nil. But .present is smarter, because it will look for other versions of missing information besides just nil.

Back in my action, if the user did successfuly sign up, then let’s add a cookie: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create user = User.new user.username = params.fetch(&quot;input_username&quot;) user.password = params.fetch(&quot;input_password&quot;) user.password_confirmation = params.fetch(&quot;input_password_confirmation&quot;) save_status = user.save if save_status == true session.store(:user_id, user.id) redirect_to(&quot;/users/#{user.username}&quot;, { :notice =&gt; &quot;Welcome, #{user.username}!&quot;}) else redirect_to(&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;, { :alert =&gt; user.errors.full_messages.to_sentence }) end end ... end {: mark_lines=“15”} Note that we are using session, rather than cookies. These are simliar but session is more secure, and you can read about it here. We use the conventional name for the cookie key, which is user_id, and we assign this key our value of the current user.id. This ID number was assigned as soon as we saved the user to the database with .save above. We can print this new ID number in our layout view template with some embedded Ruby like &lt;%= session.fetch(:user_id) %&gt;, and if we navigate around the site after we signup a new user, we should see the current user ID follow us around on every page. So that works! We also want to give the user a way to signin later. But first, let’s make a “Sign out” link. Let’s add this to our navbar: &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_out&quot;&gt;Sign Out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/users&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/photos&quot;&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; ... &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“13”} This route \"/user_sign_out\" just needs an RCAV that will remove all the cookies. We can add this route: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;new_registration_form&quot; }) get(&quot;/user_sign_out&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;toast_cookies&quot; }) # User routes # CREATE get(&quot;/insert_user_record&quot;, {:controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; }) ... end {: mark_lines=“8”} Then add this action: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def toast_cookies reset_session redirect_to(&quot;/&quot;, { :notice =&gt; &quot;See ya later!&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“4-7”} We get the method reset_session from Rails, and it just deletes all the cookies in the current session. And we are just having our action redirect the user to the homepage when they signout, and giving them a success notice there. Try to refresh your app browser and click the “Sign out” link, it should work! 38.5.1 Text Companion: Signout with reset_session "],["video-segment-signin-with-post-and-authenticate.html", "38.6 Video Segment: Signin with post and authenticate", " 38.6 Video Segment: Signin with post and authenticate Notes: time stamp 00:34:03 to 00:48:28 RCAV /user_sign_in with new_session_form action signin form with action=\"/verify_credentials\" and method=\"post\" authenticate action using user.authenticate and control flow Now we want to work on our URL path /user_sign_in.

We can mostly copy-paste from the signup form, but we will need to modify it: &lt;!--- app/views/users/signin_form.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Sign In&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/verify_credentials&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_username&quot;&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_username&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;input_username&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter your username...&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_password&quot;&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_password&quot; type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;input_password&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter your password...&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Sign in!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“3-13”} We have a new action called \"/verify_credentials\", which is what will happen when they try to sign in. We can test the new form on our app. Enter a username and password for one of the accounts you previously added to the database, and click “Sign in!”. We are now taken to a URL that looks like: /verify_credentials?input_username=[USERNAME]&amp;input_password=[PASSWORD]. That’s no good! We are showing the user’s secure password in the query string! We need to hide that by changing the form attribute method=\"post\": &lt;!--- app/views/users/signin_form.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Sign In&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/verify_credentials&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“5”} With this more advanced method, the information that we enter in the form will no longer go into a query string, and we will need to use a different route method than get(), as we’ve done. We will instead use post() to build the route in the form action: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;new_registration_form&quot; }) get(&quot;/user_sign_out&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;toast_cookies&quot; }) get(&quot;/user_sign_in&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;new_session_form&quot; }) post(&quot;/verify_credentials&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;authenticate&quot; }) # User routes # CREATE get(&quot;/insert_user_record&quot;, {:controller =&gt; &quot;users&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; }) ... end {: mark_lines=“10”} The form method and the route method must match, or Rails won’t find it. get() is the default form method, so we don’t need to write it as the attribute. Now we define \"authenticate\": # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def authenticate render({ :plain =&gt; &quot;hi&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“4-6”} Now if we refresh /user_sign_in, re-enter some login information, and click the button, then we will be taken to “hi” and there will be none of the form inputs in a query string at that URL. We need to actually make the authenticate action actually work now, by signing in the user (set the cookie with their ID number), if they put in the correct password. In pseudo-code: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def authenticate # get the username from params # get the password from params # lookup the record from the db matching username # if there&#39;s no record, redirect to signin form # if there is a record, check to see if password matches # if so, set the cookie and redirect to homepage # if not, redirect back to sign in form render({ :plain =&gt; &quot;hi&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“5-13”} Let’s do all of that now: # app/controllers/users_controller.rb class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def authenticate un = params.fetch(&quot;input_username&quot;) pw = params.fetch(&quot;input_password&quot;) # lookup the record from the db matching username user = User.where({ :username =&gt; un }).at(0) # if there&#39;s no record, redirect to signin form if user == nil redirect_to(&quot;/user_sign_in&quot;, { :alert =&gt; &quot;No one by that name &#39;round these parts&quot; }) else # if there is a record, check to see if password matches if user.authenticate(pw) # if so, set the cookie and redirect to homepage session.store(:user_id, user.id) redirect_to(&quot;/&quot;, { :notice =&gt; &quot;Welcome back #{user.username}!&quot; }) else # if not, redirect back to sign in form redirect_to(&quot;/user_sign_in&quot;, { :alert =&gt; &quot;Nice try&quot; }) end end end ... end {: mark_lines=“5-25”} Because we used has_secure_password in out app/models/user.rb model, we get the awesome method .authenticate, which we used on our instance of User above to do the oneway encryption on the input password to see if it matches that user’s encrypted password in the database. If the authentication passes, then user.authenticate(pw) returns the record, which, for the purposes of a conditional, counts as true (“truthy”, actually), and we can use it to decide the next step. With all this new code, try to play with the signin form now at /user_sign_in. Try with the right username, but wrong password, vice versa, and with no password. Finally try with everything correct. It should all work now! We now have a robust signin-signout system built with Rails. 38.6.1 Text Companion: Signin with post and authenticate "],["video-segment-git.html", "38.7 Video Segment: git", " 38.7 Video Segment: git Notes: time stamp 00:48:28 to 00:52:09 BENP: I am not transcribing this part of the video yet.

We can go into the photo index page, find that form, and modify it: BENP: why is this called all_photos.html.erb and not index.html.erb? &lt;!--- app/views/photos/all_photos.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of photos&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_photo_record&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_input&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_input&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;input_image&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a URL for the image...&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_caption&quot;&gt;Caption&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea id=&quot;browser_caption&quot; name=&quot;input_caption&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a caption for the photo...&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_user_id&quot;&gt;Owner ID&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_user_id&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;input_owner_id&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter an ID of a User&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add photo&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; ... We could change the type=\"text\" attribute to type=\"hidden\" on the “Owner ID” and pre-populate the value with the current user ID. But instead, we are just going to get rid of that field entirely: &lt;!--- app/views/photos/all_photos.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;List of photos&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_photo_record&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_input&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_input&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;input_image&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a URL for the image...&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_caption&quot;&gt;Caption&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea id=&quot;browser_caption&quot; name=&quot;input_caption&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a caption for the photo...&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add photo&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“11”} And now in the backend, when the photo is submitted an the route \"/insert_photo_record\" is called, it goes to the create action in app/controllers/photos_controller.rb. We can change the user ID, which we used to fetch from the params hash as input to the form, to come from the cookies in the session hash: # app/controllers/photos_controller.rb class PhotosController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create # user_id = params.fetch(&quot;input_owner_id&quot;) user_id = session.fetch(:user_id) image = params.fetch(&quot;input_image&quot;) caption = params.fetch(&quot;input_caption&quot;) photo = Photo.new photo.owner_id = user_id photo.image = image photo.caption = caption photo.save redirect_to(&quot;/photos/#{photo.id}&quot;) end ... end {: mark_lines=“6-7”} We set this cookie when the user signed in, so it is available in all of our controller actions! No more need for user input of their ID prior to adding a photo. Try it yourself by finding a photo URL online and adding it to the table (assuming you are signed in as a Photogram user). BENP: 00:54:10 to 00:57:00, we are getting a lecture about git committing now… probably not necessary at this point in the class. Also going into branching off and branch names. We can also go through this exact same process on the “Photo ID” and “Author ID” fields in the comment section of the photo details page. Now that we have cookies, we never want to show any ID numbers from our database to the users. BENP: why is this called details.html.erb and not show.html.erb? &lt;!--- app/views/photos/details.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Photo Details&lt;/h1&gt; ... &lt;h3&gt;Add a new comment&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_comment_record&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_photo_id&quot;&gt;Photo ID&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_photo_id&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%= @photo.id %&gt;&quot; name=&quot;input_photo_id&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_author_id&quot;&gt;Author ID&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_author_id&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;input_author_id&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_comment&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea id=&quot;browser_comment&quot; name=&quot;input_body&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a comment...&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add comment&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; This isn’t so bad, because at least the “Photo ID” is being pre-populated with the ID of the current photo whose page we are on, but the user shouldn’t have to see it. So we can change that type to \"hidden\". We still need the photo ID, because when we click “Add comment” and call the action at the end of \"/insert_comment_record\", this ID will be added to the comment record in a foreign key column that associates comments to photos. We can also get rid of the label for this hidden input. Finally, we can also once more, remove the “Author ID” field: &lt;!--- app/views/photos/details.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Photo Details&lt;/h1&gt; ... &lt;h3&gt;Add a new comment&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_comment_record&quot;&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;browser_photo_id&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%= @photo.id %&gt;&quot; name=&quot;input_photo_id&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;browser_comment&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea id=&quot;browser_comment&quot; name=&quot;input_body&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a comment...&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;button&gt;Add comment&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {: mark_lines=“9-10”} And now we need to add this ID from our cookies into the action: BENP: the code in the video and the code available on github at https://github.com/appdev-projects/photogram-signin/blob/master/app/controllers/comments_controller.rb for this controller look very different # app/controllers/comments_controller.rb class CommentsController &lt; ApplicationController def create comment = Comment.new # comment.author_id = params.fetch(&quot;input_author_id&quot;) comment.author_id = session.fetch(:user_id) comment.photo_id = params.fetch(&quot;input_photo_id&quot;) comment.body = params.fetch(&quot;input_body&quot;) comment.save redirect_to(&quot;/photos/#{comment.photo_id}&quot;) end end {: mark_lines=“7-8”} Now if we try to add a comment as a signed in user, it works, and there is only the one field to enter the comment. Now that we have authentication under our belts, there is nothing left to learn for building CRUD backed applications.

This is because you do not want to generate the standard RCAVs (index, show, etc) with the standard forms to add a new record, update a record, delete a record, etc. Instead, you need routes, actions, and templates for signing up, signing in, editing profile, cancelling an account, etc. The RCAVs that the draft:resource generator writes for you require so much modification to transform into those pages that it is easier to just start from scratch with the model generator. Fortunately, however, there is another generator that will give you a nice head start towards the boilerplate required for most sign-in/sign-out RCAVs: draft:account. Let’s say you want a model called user with columns first_name, last_name, and company_id: rails generate draft:account user first_name:string last_name:string company_id:integer You should not include email, password, password_confirmation, or password_digest in the command. email and password_digest string columns will automatically be added to the table for you. Explore the generated code. It added: A User model file. A migration which will issue the SQL transaction to create the table and columns in the database once we rails db:migrate. Routes, actions, and views for: signing up signing in editing profile signing out deleting account 40.1.1 @current_user In addition, ApplicationController, the draft:account generator wrote a method called load_current_user: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb def load_current_user the_id = session.fetch(:user_id) @current_user = User.where({ :id =&gt; the_id }).at(0) end You can call this method from within any action to easily define an instance variable called @current_user which would use the cookie created by the sign-in/sign-up actions to look up the record in the User table that represents whoever is signed in. Furthermore, it wrote a line: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb before_action(:load_current_user) This line automatically calls the load_current_user method before any action is called! That means that @current_user is automatically defined within every action and view template. If someone is signed in, it is a User; if not, it is nil. From there on out, it’s up to you to use @current_user to personalize the action/view. 40.1.2 Forcing sign in The draft:account also writes another method within ApplicationController: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb def force_user_sign_in if @current_user == nil redirect_to(&quot;/user_sign_in&quot;, { :notice =&gt; &quot;You have to sign in first.&quot; }) end end This method, if called, will redirect the user to the sign in page if they are not already signed in. This is a very common pattern in applications, and saves us the trouble of having to do a million if @current_user != nil ... all over the place before we can use @current_user safely (assuming we need a User). To call this method before every action, add this line to ApplicationController: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb # Below load_current_user before_action(:force_user_sign_in) The generator writes this line, but starts it out commented; uncomment it if you want to opt-in to forcing users to sign in. However, you need to allow them to visit the sign-in/sign-up pages while being signed-out; to do that, in UserAuthenticationController, uncomment the following line: # app/controllers/user_authentication_controller.rb skip_before_action(:force_user_sign_in, { :only =&gt; [:sign_up_form, :create, :sign_in_form, :create_cookie] Now you’re all set; a person will have to sign in before they can visit any other action in the application, and you can confidently use @current_user knowing that it will actually be a User and not nil. "],["making-changes.html", "40.2 Making Changes", " 40.2 Making Changes That’s it! You now have a solid sign-in/sign-out system to work from. There’s no magic to this generator; all it did was automate the tedium of building the many RCAVs required for sign-up/sign-in/sign-out. Since the RCAVs for authentication are so boilerplate, in the real world we often automate them (or use a gem like Devise). From here on out, it’s up to you to use @current_user to make the app do what it needs to do.

After you signup, you should be redirected to the homepage with a notice of “User account created successfully” at the top of the page. And now, when we browse around to a given movie details page like /movies/1, the key difference we note is that there is now a “Bookmark this movie!” button. If we click this button as our user “Alice”, then we are brought to the URL path /bookmarks, showing only Alice’s personal bookmarked movies. We have all the tools we need to build this application: HTML, Ruby, RCAV, params, forms, databases, and now, finally cookies for signin and signout! Photogram Signin is actually very similar to this project.

We don’t even have a database prepared. To begin from scratch, with our target in mind, step one is to figure out the data model. That means domain modeling by making sketches. But assuming that we already did that and we have a list of our tables and columns, then the first step is to create our tables. Let’s create our tables one-by-one: movies, directors, actors, and characters. For this, we will use draft at the command-line. So go to your GitPod workspace, and open a fresh terminal window to work in. To create a table for movies, the command is: rails generate model movie title:string description:text director_id:integer The command is rails generate model, the fourth input on the line (first input to the command) is the name of the table we want (singular, movie). Following this are the names of the columns we want (e.g., title), followed by their datatype (e.g., :string). When we enter that command, the output will look like: Running via Spring preloader in process 1714 invoke active_record create db/migrate/[TIME OF CREATE]_create_movies.rb create app/models/movie.rb Rails created two files here, db/migrate/[TIME OF CREATE]_create_movies.rb and app/models/movie.rb. The first db/migrate/ file is a Ruby class that, when executed, will issue the SQL to the database to actually create the table. Let’s have a look at that file: # db/migrate/[TIME OF CREATE]_create_movies.rb class CreateMovies &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0] def change create_table :movies do |t| t.string :title t.text :description t.integer :director_id t.timestamps end end end This class inherits from methods from ActiveRecord::Migration, like create_table. If we instantiate this class CreateMovies and call its method change, then it creates this table with those listed columns. If we forgot anyting from our terminal command, we can add it directly to this file, like adding a column or some default values to a column: # db/migrate/[TIME OF CREATE]_create_movies.rb class CreateMovies &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0] def change create_table :movies do |t| t.string :title, :default =&gt; &quot;Some title&quot; t.text :description t.integer :director_id t.string :image_url t.timestamps end end end {: mark_lines=“6 9”} In this case, a default on the title column doesn’t make much sense. Numerical columns are often where we put default values of “0”, so that nil doesn’t mess with any mathematical operations. If we feel good about the migration, then we can go back to the terminal and run it with: rails db:migrate This command will go into db/migrate/, look for any of the classes that haven’t already been run, instantiate them, and call their method. The output of the command looks like == [TIME OF CREATE] CreateMovies: migrating ===================== -- create_table(:movies) -&gt; 0.0019s == [TIME OF CREATE] CreateMovies: migrated (0.0024s) ============ Annotated (1): app/models/movie.rb We can now visit /rails/db in our app browser, and we will see this movies table with our specified columns. 41.2.1 Text Companion: Creating movies with generate model "],["video-segment-creating-movies-with-generate-draftresource.html", "41.3 Video Segment: Creating movies with generate draft:resource", " 41.3 Video Segment: Creating movies with generate draft:resource Notes: time stamp 00:06:27 to 00:24:23 run rails db:rollback then rails generate draft:resource movie explore config/routes.rb to view CRUD routes explore app/controllers/movies_controller.rb to view CRUD actions explore generated view templates run rails db:migrate aside into schema.rb and migration versioning This is a quick way to generate our tables. And what would be the next step? We would probably start building out the RCAVs for our movie pages, like the standard index (/movies) and show pages (e.g., /movies/1) and all of the routes, actions, and view templates associated with them, not to mention the create, update, and destroy actions. That’s straightforward, but it is quite a bit of work to type out all of this, and we’ve done it so many times already! BENP: at this point in video, there is a long RCAV dance to get movies index and show pages going. Not including this in transcript, very boilerplate stuff just to make the point that this is tedious. Well, let’s see another way. Back at the terminal, try: rails db:rollback This command is going to undo all of the work we just did to get our movies table in the database. This is the opposite of db:migrate, it undoes the most recent migration. If we look back in /rails/db, we’ll see the table is gone. If you made progress on any of the RCAVs for the movie CRUDing, then you can “discard changes” on the /git tab. Now we are back to square one. Instead of rails generate model, there’s another generator that we want to use: rails generate draft:resource movie title:string description:text director_id:integer The command is rails generate draft:resource. The other command-line inputs are the same as before. This, and many other generators prepared for this course, are available as an open-soruce gem on GitHub at https://github.com/firstdraft/draft_generators. Now, when we enter that command, the output will look like: Running via Spring preloader in process 2681 create app/controllers/movies_controller.rb invoke active_record create db/migrate/[TIME OF CREATE]_create_movies.rb create app/models/movie.rb create app/views/movies create app/views/movies/index.html.erb create app/views/movies/show.html.erb route RESTful routes insert config/routes.rb Wow! It did a bunch of stuff. It created files for me, and it inserted a bunch of routes into my config/routes.rb file: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do # Routes for the Movie resource: # CREATE post(&quot;/insert_movie&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;movies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; }) # READ get(&quot;/movies&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;movies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) get(&quot;/movies/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;movies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; }) # UPDATE post(&quot;/modify_movie/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;movies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;update&quot; }) # DELETE get(&quot;/delete_movie/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;movies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;destroy&quot; }) #------------------------------ end This file was empty before. These are exactly the five routes that we need to CRUD movies. Most of the time, we are going to want these routes for our tables. And this is all going to look very similar between tables (e.g., just replace movie with director above). We may decide to remove some routes if it doesn’t make sense to have them (e.g., a details page for a comment), but we can do that manually after they are generated. All of the conventions that we have seen for naming routes, controllers, and actions have been used. We can change the code however we want after the fact. It is all very formulaic. In addition to these routes, the generator also made the app/controllers/movies_controller.rb controller file, and fills it in with the actions: # app/controllers/movies_controller.rb class MoviesController &lt; ApplicationController def index matching_movies = Movie.all @list_of_movies = matching_movies.order({ :created_at =&gt; :desc }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;movies/index.html.erb&quot; }) end def show ... end def create ... end def update ... end def destroy ... end end These actions are almost always the same between tables, so it is again very formulaic, and can easily be automated. Of course, we may need to modify all of this code to suit our purposes, but the boilerplate is there for us. Similar to the above examples, we can also see there are view templates for views/movies/index.html.erb and views/movies/show.html.erb generated for free! There are even forms there. To actually get this movies table in our database, we still need to go to the terminal and run: rails db:migrate That will run any unrun db/migrate/ files. If you haven’t run rails db:migrate yet (you have pending migration files), then Rails will throw a “Migrations are pending” error when you try to visit your app browser. Now we can go to our app browser and manually navigate to /movies. We see that we can add a movie with the form here, and once on the details page, there is a form to edit the movie and a “Delete movie” link. All of this works, try it out. CRUD! BENP: based on student Q there is a diversion to the schema.rb file to show migration versioning. I’m not transcribing this, hard to see where it fits in, maybe too much aside here. The student followup Q also leads you to show deleting migration files, or dropping tables. Showing rails db:drop (risky). 00:20:30 to 00:23:53 This shortcut gets us up and running fast, but when you use it, you own that code, and need to be prepared to modify it accordingly. Likely, it won’t be exactly what you want. 41.3.1 Text Companion: Creating movies with generate draft:resource "],["video-segment-generate-draftresource-for-entire-database.html", "41.4 Video Segment: generate draft:resource for Entire Database", " 41.4 Video Segment: generate draft:resource for Entire Database Notes: time stamp 00:24:23 to 00:27:00 run rails db:rollback then rails generate draft:resource and rails db:migrate for all tables in database Let’s undo and redo these steps with the proper tables and columns: rails db:rollback This drops our most recent migration of the movies table. And we can also “Discard changes” on the /git tab. The proper command we want for all of our tables are: rails generate draft:resource movie title:string year:integer duration:integer director_id:integer description:text image:string Enter this to generate the RCAV and CRUD code, and then run a rails db:migrate to create the table and columns in our database. Once you do this, visit the new URL paths in your app browser to see if everything looks okay. If it looks good, then definitely do a /git commit, because generators write so much code that if there is a mistake it will be difficult to undo them without the ability to jump back to an earlier snapshot.. Once you’ve done this, repeat these steps for the other three tables and routes in our database: rails generate draft:resource actor name:string dob:date bio:text image:string Then rails db:migrate, check it out, and /git commit. rails generate draft:resource director name:string dob:date bio:text image:string Then rails db:migrate, check it out, and /git commit. rails generate draft:resource character name:string actor_id:integer movie_id:integer Then rails db:migrate, check it out, and /git commit. BENP: at 00:27:00 to 00:29:52 there is another aside into spinning up an app from scratch with base-rails and generators, not transcribing this 41.4.1 Text Companion: generate draft:resource for Entire Database "],["video-segment-association-accessor-methods.html", "41.5 Video Segment: Association Accessor Methods", " 41.5 Video Segment: Association Accessor Methods Notes: time stamp 00:31:03 to 00:34:40 use belongs_to and has_many on the table models can use https://association-accessors.firstdraft.com Now that we have all our model files, we should add the association accessor methods for all of our 1-N and N-N relationships. You can use the association accessors tool, or just type it out if you remember how it works for each of our models, starting with Movie: # app/models/movie.rb ... class Movie &lt; ApplicationRecord belongs_to :director has_many :characters end {: mark_lines=“5-6”} Then Director: # app/models/director.rb ... class Director &lt; ApplicationRecord has_many :filmography, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Movie&quot; end {: mark_lines=“5”} Note, that since we didn’t give the method for the movies a director is associated with the formulaic name of movies, but rather filmography, we needed to be explicit about the class name. Then Actor: # app/models/actor.rb ... class Actor &lt; ApplicationRecord has_many :characters has_many :filmography, :through =&gt; :characters, :source =&gt; :movie end {: mark_lines=“5-6”} BENP: have through and source been introduced on video or just in a reading? Because we used a method movie contained in the Character model for the filmography method here (it is an indirect N-N association, so we use has_many with through and source BENP: is that correct, added this note later), we need to make sure that is also set up: # app/models/character.rb ... class Character &lt; ApplicationRecord belongs_to :movie belongs_to :actor end {: mark_lines=“5-6”} And we can actually go back to Movie now, and establish a cast method that lists the actors in a movie with this new connection: # app/models/movie.rb ... class Movie &lt; ApplicationRecord belongs_to :director has_many :characters has_many :cast, :through =&gt; :characters, :source =&gt; :actor end {: mark_lines=“8”} In the above accessors, we are just going straight away into some different Ruby syntaxes than we may be used to. You can re-read this for reference. As you go out and begin reading StackOverflow or blog posts to figure things out, you need to be aware of and comfortable with the common syntaxes used. We should definitely make another /git commit now. 41.5.1 Text Companion: Association Accessor Methods "],["video-segment-nav-links-and-sample_data.html", "41.6 Video Segment: Nav Links and sample_data", " 41.6 Video Segment: Nav Links and sample_data Notes: time stamp 00:34:40 to 00:37:23 add links to app/views/layouts/application.html.erb run sample_data point out loading data from a CSV and adding a sample_data rake task Let’s quickly add a navbar so we can click around in our app without manually entering URLs. As usual, this will go in the app/views/layouts/application.html.erb file: &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;MSM SIGNIN&lt;/title&gt; &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt; &lt;!-- Expand the number of characters we can use in the document beyond basic ASCII  --&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Make it responsive to small screens --&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no&quot;&gt; &lt;%= csp_meta_tag %&gt; &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &#39;application&#39;, media: &#39;all&#39; %&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/movies&quot;&gt;Movies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/directors&quot;&gt;Directors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/actors&quot;&gt;Actors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/characters&quot;&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“19-32”} Now that the app is looking good with a navbar, the next step is to run rails sample_data to get some random data into MSM. This is just like before. But for your own work, you would need to write this sample_data script yourself to get test data. There are two chapters to help you with that: loading data from a CSV and adding a sample_data rake task. BENP: this sample_data stuff comes up again later for random user data? or is that in the Bootstrap Task List? 41.6.1 Text Companion: Nav Links and sample_data "],["video-segment-validates-and-summarize-startup.html", "41.7 Video Segment: validates and Summarize Startup", " 41.7 Video Segment: validates and Summarize Startup Notes: time stamp 00:37:23 to 00:40:25 add validates :title, :presence =&gt; true to app/models/movie.rb summarize starting from scratch steps To summarize, the standard setup steps when building any app is: first domain modeling, then generating resources once the table names and columns are defined, and then adding associations add validations (we skipped this, but there is a reading here). Let’s return to validations, which are ways of checking that only “good” data is entered into our database. We can add a validation to the Movie class: # app/models/movie.rb ... class Movie &lt; ApplicationRecord validates :title, :presence =&gt; true belongs_to :director has_many :characters has_many :cast, :through =&gt; :characters, :source =&gt; :actor end {: mark_lines=“5”} This added code is saying that a movie must have a title, or it will not be added to the database. The SQL will not be issued by .save on a Movie instance without a value in this column. (Recall that errors on a given instance of a class can be accessed with the method .errors or .errors.full_messages to get any array of strings for printing and showing the user.) It is up to you to put boundaries on your data using validates, but it is generally a very good idea to do so frequently to keep your database in good shape. Back to the summary: we domain modelled, generated resources, added association accessors, added validations, wrote and ran a sample_data task and gave ourselves a navbar. These are standard steps we do for all of our projects! Once you have them all done, be sure to /git commit. 41.7.1 Text Companion: validates and Summarize Startup "],["video-segment-generate-draftaccount.html", "41.8 Video Segment: generate draft:account", " 41.8 Video Segment: generate draft:account Notes: time stamp 00:47:13 to 01:02:15 getting users table with draft:account explore new CRUD routes, models, and actions Let’s talk about the next table, users. In our target, the new functionality is that a signed in user can bookmark movies, so we need accounts, and we’re going to need a bookmarks table. We can model this in firstdraft and then use co-pilot to get the generator code. BENP: from 00:47:40 to 00: there is a brief show-and-tell of domain modeling in firstdraft with a users table and bookmarks table and then using co-pilot to get the command line code. There is also an aside into trying to generate the users with draft:resource and why that doesn’t work. Not transcribing this, because it is very visual. Our users table is not going to have the typical CRUD RCAVs that our other tables did, so draft:resource is not going to work. We probably don’t want to show a list of all users, nor do we want a link to “Delete user” (rather a signout), and we also want password encryption handling, just to name a few differences to our other database tables. Because this is so different (but still formulaic between apps), there is a very specific command-line tool for this users table: rails generate draft:account user first_name:string last_name:string The new tool is draft:account. The arguments are the table name and the columns we want, excluding email and password, which will automatically be added as username and the encrypted password_digest column, respectively. What did running that tool do in our routes? # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;movies&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) # Routes for the User account: # SIGN UP FORM get(&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;user_authentication&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;sign_up_form&quot; }) # CREATE RECORD post(&quot;/insert_user&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;user_authentication&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; }) # EDIT PROFILE FORM get(&quot;/edit_user_profile&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;user_authentication&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;edit_profile_form&quot; }) # UPDATE RECORD post(&quot;/modify_user&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;user_authentication&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;update&quot; }) # DELETE RECORD get(&quot;/cancel_user_account&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;user_authentication&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;destroy&quot; }) # ------------------------------ # SIGN IN FORM get(&quot;/user_sign_in&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;user_authentication&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;sign_in_form&quot; }) # AUTHENTICATE AND STORE COOKIE post(&quot;/user_verify_credentials&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;user_authentication&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create_cookie&quot; }) # SIGN OUT get(&quot;/user_sign_out&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;user_authentication&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;destroy_cookies&quot; }) ... end {: mark_lines=“4”} (We added the / route above, so the new signup route will have somewhere built to redirect to.) This tool added all of the signup, signin, signout stuff that we needed for our user accounts! This is what you wrote by hand for the final Photogram project. The tool also generated all of the controllers and view templates associated with these routes. If we now rails db:migrate, all of the routes will work! For instance, try out the URL path /user_sign_up to make a new account. Boom! You can go look at /rails/db and you will see the new users table with the account you added and an encrypted password in the “Password digest” column. We can look at the new model as well: # app/models/user.rb ... class User &lt; ApplicationRecord validates :email, :uniqueness =&gt; { :case_sensitive =&gt; false } validates :email, :presence =&gt; true has_secure_password end And we see that validations have been added, and the has_secure_password method from the bcrypt gem is also there. That gives us the .password and .password_confirmation method that we would find in our create action in the controller: # app/controllers/user_authentication_controller.rb class UserAuthenticationController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create @user = User.new @user.email = params.fetch(&quot;query_email&quot;) @user.password = params.fetch(&quot;query_password&quot;) @user.password_confirmation = params.fetch(&quot;query_password_confirmation&quot;) @user.first_name = params.fetch(&quot;query_first_name&quot;) @user.last_name = params.fetch(&quot;query_last_name&quot;) save_status = @user.save if save_status == true session[:user_id] = @user.id redirect_to(&quot;/&quot;, { :notice =&gt; &quot;User account created successfully.&quot;}) else redirect_to(&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;, { :alert =&gt; @user.errors.full_messages.to_sentence }) end end ... end {: mark_lines=“8-9 15”} Nice! All of the stuff you did in the Photogram Signin homework is automated now. We also see that the generator is placing the user ID into the cookies, so that we can tailor the app experience for the signed in user: session[:user_id] = @user.id. Again, you need to own the code that was generated so that you can modify things, but it’s a major shortcut. If you want to change things, remember to use “Inspect” in your browser to find the routes you want to modify. You can also use the server log in the GitPod terminal running bin/server to figure out what you want to change and where in the code it is. 41.8.1 Text Companion: generate draft:account "],["video-segment-conditional-links-alerts-and-notices.html", "41.9 Video Segment: Conditional Links, Alerts, and Notices", " 41.9 Video Segment: Conditional Links, Alerts, and Notices Notes: time stamp 01:02:15 to 01:10:40 control flow showing of links in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb using if session.fetch(:user_id) == nil explore :alert and :notice in app/controllers/movies_controller.rb add alerts and notices to application layout Now that our account pages are ready, we can again add some links to the navbar to avoid all the manual entering of URLs: &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/movies&quot;&gt;Movies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/directors&quot;&gt;Directors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/actors&quot;&gt;Actors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/characters&quot;&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_in&quot;&gt;Sign in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_out&quot;&gt;Sign out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“24-32”} However, we want these links accessible only under certain conditions depending on the status of a visitor.

Right now, it’s difficult to tell what is happening when we signin, signout, create a record, etc. We would like some kind of notifications to alert the user to the success or failure of various clicks. We don’t want to do this with a bunch of new view templates, because we are using redirect_to for a lot of these clicks. If we look in a given action (like update for our movies table), we will see a tool for showing these notices and alerts: # app/controllers/movies_controller.rb class MoviesController &lt; ApplicationController ... def update the_id = params.fetch(&quot;path_id&quot;) the_movie = Movie.where({ :id =&gt; the_id }).at(0) the_movie.title = params.fetch(&quot;query_title&quot;) the_movie.year = params.fetch(&quot;query_year&quot;) the_movie.duration = params.fetch(&quot;query_duration&quot;) the_movie.director_id = params.fetch(&quot;query_director_id&quot;) the_movie.description = params.fetch(&quot;query_description&quot;) the_movie.image = params.fetch(&quot;query_image&quot;) if the_movie.valid? the_movie.save redirect_to(&quot;/movies/#{the_movie.id}&quot;, { :notice =&gt; &quot;Movie updated successfully.&quot;} ) else redirect_to(&quot;/movies/#{the_movie.id}&quot;, { :alert =&gt; the_movie.errors.full_messages.to_sentence }) end end ... end {: mark_lines=“18 20”} When a movie is successfully updated and saved (because it was deemed valid, another new method), then the redirect_to has a second hash argument with a notice and a message. On the other hand, if the new movie is invalid and not saved, the second hash argument to redirect_to contains an alert and a message. This alert message is coming from the Movie object that we are trying to save, which is called the_movie, and the method to get the error message is .errors. We make the message look nicer for printing in the browser as well with .full_messages.to_sentence. Now, where should those alerts go? We could put them directly on the view template page. Better yet, we can put them in the layout file so they appear on every page when they exist! &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/movies&quot;&gt;Movies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/directors&quot;&gt;Directors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/actors&quot;&gt;Actors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/characters&quot;&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% if session.fetch(:user_id) == nil %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_in&quot;&gt;Sign in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% else %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_out&quot;&gt;Sign out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;color: green&quot;&gt;&lt;%= notice %&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&lt;%= alert %&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“38 40”} Our helper variables notice and alert (that we defined in the redirect_to hash argument), are also styled here with a green and red color, respectively. Now they will be on any page and we don’t need to copy-paste that code onto all our view templates where we might need them. Once you get all of this together, it’s a good time to /git commit. 41.9.1 Text Companion: Conditional Links, Alerts, and Notices "],["video-segment-bookmark.html", "41.10 Video Segment: Bookmark", " 41.10 Video Segment: Bookmark Notes: time stamp 01:10:40 to 01:28:20 run rails generate draft:resource bookmark tailoring user experience by allowing them to add records to a join table create action=\"/insert_bookmark\" form in app/views/movies/show.html.erb use the provided CRUD action, changing parameter names to matchup We also need to make sure that we have the user bookmarks join table in our app. We can do that by running our familiar draft:resource generator: rails generate draft:resource bookmark user_id:integer movie_id:integer Then executing a rails db:migrate to get the table in our database. You should also re-run rails sample_data as this point, because it will also create some users and bookmark data. Now the trick is going to be getting a “Bookmark this movie!” button on the movie details pages, and getting a list of personalized bookmarks to show to the signed in user. Before we proceed, we can ask rails grade for the specific requirements for the project to see what’s left to do. There’s still a lot of work left to be done on the bookmarks! We will walk through this process, because it’s important. If you can do this, you can build just about any app with user accounts and a tailored CRUD experience. The steps are always the same: A user signs in They create stuff, often by creating a record in a join table to connect themselves to another entity This can be liking a photo, bidding on an item, commenting on something We give the user the ability to un-join from the entity (destroy the join table record) So how do we do this? Let’s identify what CRUD actions are happening in the database when a user clicks the “Bookmark this movie!” button in our target. In this case, a record is being created in the bookmarks table that has a value for the signed in user’s ID and for the movie’s ID, which we called user_id and movie_id. Even though there’s nothing for the user to fill out, since we are creating a record, we will use a form in our movie details view template for this: &lt;!--- app/views/movies/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Movie #&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt; details &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Bookmark this movie!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“9-15”} The boilerplate for this form would work if we had the user’s type into the first input box a valid user ID and the second input box a valid movie ID, then have the action take those IDs and add them as a record in bookmarks. There are a few ways to do this. We could do the most straighforward RCAV to finish this by defining a new route like action=\"/add_bookmark\", create a form that will take type=\"hidden\" inputs (the two IDs) from our cookies (session.fetch(:user_id)) and current movie page ( and @the_movie.id), save a new Bookmark instance in the action associated with the new route, and redirect the user somewhere. BENP: at this point you spend awhile showing the basic RCAV steps outlined above, but then a student asks why not use what was pre-built, and you switch to that. I am not transcribing the whole basic RCAV part because it goes unused. The missing transcription is 01:18:10 to 01:23:30 Our form in the end might look something like: &lt;!--- app/views/movies/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Movie #&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt; details &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/add_bookmark&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;the_user_id&quot;, value=&quot;&lt;%= session.fetch(:user_id) %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;the_movie_id&quot;, value=&quot;&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Bookmark this movie!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“9-10 12”} And if we wired up the action associated with \"/add_bookmark\" correctly in our routes and controller file, then it should save a bookmark. But we can use another method here! If we look in our routes, we see there is already an action defined in the bookmarks section that does what we intend: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do ... # Routes for the Bookmark resource: # CREATE post(&quot;/insert_bookmark&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;bookmarks&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;create&quot; }) # READ get(&quot;/bookmarks&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;bookmarks&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) # get(&quot;/bookmarks&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;bookmarks&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;user_index&quot; }) get(&quot;/bookmarks/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;bookmarks&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; }) # UPDATE post(&quot;/modify_bookmark/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;bookmarks&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;update&quot; }) # DELETE get(&quot;/delete_bookmark/:path_id&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;bookmarks&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;destroy&quot; }) #------------------------------ ... end {: mark_lines=“9”} And it even uses the post() method to keep the input out of the query string. Let’s look at the action that was generated: # app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb class BookmarksController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create the_bookmark = Bookmark.new the_bookmark.user_id = params.fetch(&quot;query_user_id&quot;) the_bookmark.movie_id = params.fetch(&quot;query_movie_id&quot;) if the_bookmark.valid? the_bookmark.save redirect_to(&quot;/bookmarks&quot;, { :notice =&gt; &quot;Bookmark created successfully.&quot; }) else redirect_to(&quot;/bookmarks&quot;, { :alert =&gt; the_bookmark.errors.full_messages.to_sentence }) end end ... end This looks nice, but we just need to be sure that we use exactly the same parameter names in our new form and the generated action if we want it to work: &lt;!--- app/views/movies/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Movie #&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt; details &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_bookmark&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;query_user_id&quot;, value=&quot;&lt;%= session.fetch(:user_id) %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;query_movie_id&quot;, value=&quot;&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Bookmark this movie!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“9-10 12”} But there’s a problem. If we go to a movie details page as a signed in user and inspect the source code in our browser, the savvy user can manually change the user ID value in the \"hidden\" form field! We can modify our form (remember session is available in any action in our app) to eliminate this issue. Let’s remove the user ID input from the form: &lt;!--- app/views/movies/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Movie #&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt; details &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_bookmark&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;query_movie_id&quot;, value=&quot;&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Bookmark this movie!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“9-13”} And modify our action: # app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb class BookmarksController &lt; ApplicationController ... def create the_bookmark = Bookmark.new #the_bookmark.user_id = params.fetch(&quot;query_user_id&quot;) the_bookmark.user_id = session.fetch(:user_id) the_bookmark.movie_id = params.fetch(&quot;query_movie_id&quot;) if the_bookmark.valid? the_bookmark.save redirect_to(&quot;/bookmarks&quot;, { :notice =&gt; &quot;Bookmark created successfully.&quot; }) else redirect_to(&quot;/bookmarks&quot;, { :alert =&gt; the_bookmark.errors.full_messages.to_sentence }) end end ... end {: mark_lines=“7-8”} Now the user can’t tamper with the user ID in the form! 41.10.1 Text Companion: Bookmark "],["video-segment-un-bookmark.html", "41.11 Video Segment: Un-Bookmark", " 41.11 Video Segment: Un-Bookmark Notes: time stamp 01:28:20 to 01:34:42 add conditional flow to bookmark action with Bookmark.where({ :movie_id =&gt; @the_movie.id, :user_id =&gt; session.fetch(:user_id) }) add href=\"/delete_bookmark/&lt;%= the_bookmark.id %&gt;\" link When we click on “Bookmark this movie!” our app still shows us the button, even if the signed in user already has it bookmarked. What we want, is an “un-bookmark” button, which will destroy the record in our join table bookmarks. Back in our view template for a movie details page, we can add some conditional behavior to get this working. In pseudo-code: &lt;!--- app/views/movies/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Movie #&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt; details &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;% if .... %&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_bookmark&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;query_movie_id&quot;, value=&quot;&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Bookmark this movie!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;% else %&gt; Un-bookmark &lt;% end %&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“9-17”} What should our condition be? We want to know if the currently signed in user has the current movie bookmarked. We do this by looking in the bookmarks table for the record that meets this condition using .where and two conditions. This can be done in a chained format: Bookmark.where({ :movie_id =&gt; @the_movie.id }).where({ :user_id =&gt; session.fetch(:user_id) }) or, as two arguments in the hash to filter by multiple columns: Bookmark.where({ :movie_id =&gt; @the_movie.id, :user_id =&gt; session.fetch(:user_id) }) This .where will return the bookmark for the current movie if it exists, and we can use that result to decide what button to show the user: &lt;!--- app/views/movies/show.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Movie #&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt; details &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;% current_user_bookmarks = Bookmark.where({ :movie_id =&gt; @the_movie.id, :user_id =&gt; session.fetch(:user_id) }) %&gt; &lt;% the_bookmark = current_user_bookmarks.at(0) %&gt; &lt;% if the_bookmark == nil %&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_bookmark&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;query_movie_id&quot;, value=&quot;&lt;%= @the_movie.id %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;button&gt;Bookmark this movie!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;% else %&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/delete_bookmark/&lt;%= the_bookmark.id %&gt;&quot;&gt;Un-bookmark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ... {: mark_lines=“9 11-12 19”} Note that we used the already available delete route generated for us in the href=\"\" attribute to the “Un-bookmark” link! We just needed to be sure that we embedded the current bookmark ID number into the second segment of that route. Try to bookmark and un-bookmark some movies as a signed in user, does everything work as expected? Hopefully so! The conditional pattern that we put in our view template is a very common pattern. We want to tailor the experience for a user depending on who they are and what they’ve done in the app. Let’s make a /git commit if everything is working. 41.11.1 Text Companion: Un-Bookmark "],["video-segment-bookmark-index-for-current-user.html", "41.12 Video Segment: Bookmark Index for Current User", " 41.12 Video Segment: Bookmark Index for Current User Notes: time stamp 01:47:22 to 01:51:35 conditional flow to application layout for showing bookmarks modify index action in app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb three primary uses of session.fetch(:user_id) cookie define association accessor methods in user, bookmark, and movie models In the target, we want /bookmarks to be a personalized list of bookmarks, not all of the bookmarks in the bookmarks table as it is now in our app. Let’s start on this by altering the layout view template, to make a link to the bookmarks only visible for a signed in user: &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;ul&gt; ... &lt;% if session.fetch(:user_id) == nil %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_in&quot;&gt;Sign in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% else %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/bookmarks&quot;&gt;My bookmarks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_out&quot;&gt;Sign out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; ... &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“21-23”} Now if the user is signed out, then the link will not be visible to them. You should test this in the app yourself to make sure it worked. The link is still showing everyone’s bookmarks, so let’s make the controller filter the table to only show the signed in user’s bookmarks. That means modifying the index action in the controller: # app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb class BookmarksController &lt; ApplicationController def index matching_bookmarks = Bookmark.where({ :user_id =&gt; session.fetch(:user_id) }) @list_of_bookmarks = matching_bookmarks.order({ :created_at =&gt; :desc }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;bookmarks/index.html.erb&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“5”} Now we filter by the user_id contained as a cookie in session. When we visit the user’s bookmark page, it should now only show these records. BENP: important point below There are three primary things that you will do with the session.fetch(:user_id) cookie: Populating foreign key columns Conditionally hiding and showing content in the view template Filtering down queries We just showed an example of this third option. Our modification to the action is working, but it would be nicer if we could just write matching_bookmarks = current_user.bookmarks rather than matching_bookmarks = Bookmark.where({ :user_id =&gt; session.fetch(:user_id) }). We want to avoid writing queries like these all over our app. We want association accessor methods that we can call on User objects. Let’s define such an accessor in the User model: # app/models/user.rb ... class User &lt; ApplicationRecord validates :email, :uniqueness =&gt; { :case_sensitive =&gt; false } validates :email, :presence =&gt; true has_secure_password has_many :bookmarks has_many :movies, :through =&gt; :bookmarks end {: mark_lines=“9-10”} The second method movies that we defined isn’t necessary, but we might as well add it in case we need it later. While we’re at it, you should also be sure your association accessor methods have been defined in the Bookmark model: # app/models/bookmark.rb ... class Bookmark &lt; ApplicationRecord belongs_to :user belongs_to :movie end {: mark_lines=“5-6”} And we can also add the bookmark associations to the Movie model: # app/models/movie.rb ... class Movie &lt; ApplicationRecord validates :title, :presence =&gt; true belongs_to :director has_many :characters has_many :cast, :through =&gt; :characters, :source =&gt; :actor has_many :bookmarks, has_many :bookmarkers, :through =&gt; :bookmarks, :source =&gt; :user end {: mark_lines=“12-13”} With our association accessor methods sorted, we can return to our bookmarks controller and modify the index action: # app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb class BookmarksController &lt; ApplicationController def index # matching_bookmarks = Bookmark.where({ :user_id =&gt; session.fetch(:user_id) }) @current_user = User.where({ :id =&gt; session[:user_id] }).at(0) matching_bookmarks = @current_user.bookmarks @list_of_bookmarks = matching_bookmarks.order({ :created_at =&gt; :desc }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;bookmarks/index.html.erb&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“5 7-8”} Now if you revist the user’s bookmark page, everything should still work as before, but we’ve made the code more robust with our accessors. 41.12.1 Text Companion: Bookmark Index for Current User "],["video-segment-current_user.html", "41.13 Video Segment: @current_user", " 41.13 Video Segment: @current_user Notes: time stamp 01:51:35 to 02:00:20 add load_current_user action to app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb to get @current_user use before_action(:load_current_user) in app/controllers/application_controller.rb to get @current_user everywhere apply @current_user.bookmarks in bookmarks index action If you are building an app with accounts and authentication, almost every page is going to be somehow tailored to the current user. As a small example, the top of the bookmarks page shouldn’t say “List of all bookmarks”, but rather “[CURRENT USER]’s bookmarks”. We would like an instance of User we can use all over our app (called @current_user) without needing to constantly use the session cookie to filter the users table. One way of doing this would be to put something like @current_user = User.where({ :id =&gt; session[:user_id] }).at(0) at the top of every action in our app. Pretty annoying! There’s another way to get this variable available in all of our actions and view templates: # app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb class BookmarksController &lt; ApplicationController def load_current_user @current_user = User.where({ :id =&gt; session[:user_id] }).at(0) end def index # matching_bookmarks = Bookmark.where({ :user_id =&gt; session.fetch(:user_id) }) # @current_user = User.where({ :id =&gt; session[:user_id] }).at(0) self.load_current_user matching_bookmarks = @current_user.bookmarks @list_of_bookmarks = matching_bookmarks.order({ :created_at =&gt; :desc }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;bookmarks/index.html.erb&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“4-6 11-12”} We defined a new method load_current_user that would filter the users table and get the @current_user variable, and now we just need to call that other instance method from within the index action using self. This is more concise than querying over and over again, but we would still need to put self.load_current_user at the top of every action. Still not great. But there’s yet another way of avoiding this repetition. There’s a special feature inherited from ApplicationController that allows us to call any instance method before any other action in the controller, before_action(): # app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb class BookmarksController &lt; ApplicationController before_action(:load_current_user) def load_current_user @current_user = User.where({ :id =&gt; session[:user_id] }).at(0) end def index # matching_bookmarks = Bookmark.where({ :user_id =&gt; session.fetch(:user_id) }) # @current_user = User.where({ :id =&gt; session[:user_id] }).at(0) # self.load_current_user matching_bookmarks = @current_user.bookmarks @list_of_bookmarks = matching_bookmarks.order({ :created_at =&gt; :desc }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;bookmarks/index.html.erb&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“5 15”} All we need to give this is the name of one of the methods we defined. It will automatically call that method before any action is executed. So we no longer need the self.load_current_user in our actions. @current_user will always be available when we call an action in our controller. If no one is signed in then User.where({ :id =&gt; session[:user_id] }).at(0) will return nil, and thus @current_user will be nil. This code should really go in every controller, not just bookmarks. That would again mean a lot of repetition. But, as usual, there’s a shortcut! Since we want this to run in every controller, we can put it in the parent controller ApplicationController from which every child controller inherits: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base before_action(:load_current_user) # Uncomment line 5 in this file and line 3 in UserAuthenticationController if you want to force users to sign in before any other actions. # before_action(:force_user_sign_in) def load_current_user the_id = session[:user_id] @current_user = User.where({ :id =&gt; the_id }).first end def force_user_sign_in if @current_user == nil redirect_to(&quot;/user_sign_in&quot;, { :notice =&gt; &quot;You have to sign in first.&quot; }) end end def homepage render(template: &quot;navigation/homepage&quot;) end end We did not even need to add any of this code, it was already there! Because the draft:account generator added it for us. Nice. So @current_user has been available to us this whole time. As an example usage, what if in the navbar we wanted the user’s first name in the link to their bookmarks? We can easily write: &lt;!--- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb ---&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;ul&gt; ... &lt;!-- &lt;% if session.fetch(:user_id) == nil %&gt; --&gt; &lt;% if @current_user == nil %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_up&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_in&quot;&gt;Sign in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% else %&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/bookmarks&quot;&gt;&lt;%= @current_user.first_name %&gt; bookmarks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/user_sign_out&quot;&gt;Sign out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; ... &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; {: mark_lines=“13-14 23”} We also removed the session.fetch(:user_id) and replaced it with simply @current_user. We don’t really need to use session.fetch(:user_id) anywhere other than the ApplicationController file now. And back in our bookmarks controller, we don’t need the code we had built up anymore, so we can clean it up: # app/controllers/bookmarks_controller.rb class BookmarksController &lt; ApplicationController def index matching_bookmarks = @current_user.bookmarks @list_of_bookmarks = matching_bookmarks.order({ :created_at =&gt; :desc }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;bookmarks/index.html.erb&quot; }) end ... end {: mark_lines=“5”} Account authentication and signin is so common and so important to apps, that we usually just use automated generators like here. We rarely mess with that code at all. We want our accounts to be secure, so we trust the community and use available resources (gems!) that everyone else does. 41.13.1 Text Companion: @current_user "],["video-segment-bookmark-drop-down-form.html", "41.14 Video Segment: Bookmark Drop-Down Form", " 41.14 Video Segment: Bookmark Drop-Down Form Notes: time stamp 02:00:20 to end create a drop-down form on app/views/bookmarks/index.html.erb using &lt;select name=\"query_movie_id\"&gt; with &lt;option value=\"&lt;%= a_movie.id %&gt;\"&gt; hiding ID keys from user The last thing to discuss together is the add a new bookmark form on a user’s bookmarks page. In the target, there is a drop-down menu with all of the movies in our database and a button “Bookmark this movie!”. In our app, there is a much worse form that involves inputing ID numbers, which we already had to find a way around on the movie details page earlier. The current form in the view template for the list of bookmarks looks like: &lt;!--- app/views/bookmarks/index.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h2&gt; Add a new bookmark &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_bookmark&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;user_id_box&quot;&gt; User &lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;user_id_box&quot; name=&quot;query_user_id&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;movie_id_box&quot;&gt; Movie &lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;movie_id_box&quot; name=&quot;query_movie_id&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;button&gt; Create bookmark &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; We have &lt;input&gt;s for the user to fill in. Well, we already know from our movie details form work that action=\"/insert_bookmark\", is doing the right thing and getting the current user ID, so we can delete the “User” field: &lt;!--- app/views/bookmarks/index.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h2&gt; Add a new bookmark &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_bookmark&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;movie_id_box&quot;&gt; Movie &lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;movie_id_box&quot; name=&quot;query_movie_id&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;button&gt; Create bookmark &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; {: mark_lines=“11”} But we still need to enter a valid movie ID. We want a drop-down menu with the movie title instead. We will use some new HTML tags for that: &lt;!--- app/views/bookmarks/index.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h2&gt; Add a new bookmark &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_bookmark&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;movie_id_box&quot;&gt; Movie &lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;movie_id_box&quot; name=&quot;query_movie_id&quot;&gt; &lt;select&gt; &lt;% Movie.all.order(:title).each do |a_movie| %&gt; &lt;option&gt; &lt;%= a_movie.title %&gt; &lt;/option&gt; &lt;/select&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;button&gt; Create bookmark &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; {: mark_lines=“19-24”} In a form, &lt;select&gt;&lt;/select&gt; and &lt;option&gt;&lt;/option&gt; is basically the same as an unstructured list &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;, but it renders as a drop-down menu rather than a bulleted list of items. If you visit the bookmark’s page for a user now, then you will see a drop-down menu! But the form still doesn’t work and still has a field for movie ID, which we would need to fill in. Let’s fix that: &lt;!--- app/views/bookmarks/index.html.erb ---&gt; ... &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h2&gt; Add a new bookmark &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;/insert_bookmark&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;select name=&quot;query_movie_id&quot;&gt; &lt;% Movie.all.order(:title).each do |a_movie| %&gt; &lt;option value=&quot;&lt;%= a_movie.id %&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;%= a_movie.title %&gt; &lt;/option&gt; &lt;/select&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;button&gt; Create bookmark &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; {: mark_lines=“11 13 15”} Now we made sure that our selection from the list went into the params hash under the key query_movie_id, we got rid of the previous input and label, and we made sure that the value for the selected movie was not the title, which is shown, but rather the movie ID, which is hidden from the user. Always hide primary and foreign keys from your users in your view templates. Now would be a time for a rails grade and a /git commit! BENP: there is some additional cleanup that seems rather thrown in in the last ~10 minutes. It also leads to writing some more validations. I’m not transcribing that bit.

"],["activerecord_relation-array-of-records.html", "B.2 ActiveRecord_Relation (array of records)", " B.2 ActiveRecord_Relation (array of records) B.2.1 All Array methods ActiveRecord_Relations inherit from Array, so all Array methods work: .each .at() (and its aliases [], .first for .at(0), .last for .at(-1)) .count .reverse .sample .shuffle B.2.2 .where ActiveRecord_Relation#where(Hash) ⇒ ActiveRecord_Relation Call .where on an ActiveRecord_Relation to filter the array of records based on some criteria. where returns an ActiveRecord_Relation based on the given Hash. .where returns an ActiveRecord_Relation regardless of how many results there are. In particular, even if there is only one result, the return value will still be another ActiveRecord_Relation. The argument to .where is usually a Hash: Filtering by an exact match within a column: { :id =&gt; 42 } Filter by multiple columns at once: { :photo_id =&gt; 23, :user_id =&gt; 42 } Filter using an Array (results will match any of the values in the Array): { :owner_id =&gt; [4, 8, 15 ] } Filtering within a range of values: { :dob =&gt; (1.year.ago..Date.today) } { :last_name =&gt; (&quot;A&quot;..&quot;C&quot;) } If you really want to, you can omit the curly brackets around the Hash for brevity, and Ruby will figure out what you mean. So, ultimately, you can write something like this: Contact.where(:last_name =&gt; (&quot;A&quot;..&quot;C&quot;)) instead of this: Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; (&quot;A&quot;..&quot;C&quot;) }) Related Methods: .where.not, .or, .limit, .order Full explanation B.2.3 where.not ActiveRecord_Relation#where.not(Hash) ⇒ ActiveRecord_Relation Call .where.not on an ActiveRecord_Relation to filter the array of records to exclude records based on the given Hash. .where.not will return an ActiveRecord_Relation. Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; &quot;Mouse&quot; }).where.not({ :first_name =&gt; &quot;Mickey&quot; }) Returns an ActiveRecord_Relation. The acceptable arguments to .not are the same as to .where; see that method for a list. Related methods: .where, .order, .limit Full explanation B.2.4 .or ActiveRecord_Relation#or(ActiveRecord_Relation) ⇒ ActiveRecord_Relation Call .or on an ActiveRecord_Relation to combine the array of records with another array of records: Returns an ActiveRecord_Relation. The argument to .or must be another ActiveRecord_Relation from the same table. Broadens the result set. Contact.where({ :first_name =&gt; &quot;Mickey&quot; }).or(Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; &quot;Betina&quot; })) Full explanation B.2.5 .order ActiveRecord_Relation#order(Hash) ⇒ ActiveRecord_Relation or ActiveRecord_Relation.order(Symbol) ⇒ ActiveRecord_Relation Call .order on an ActiveRecord_Relation to sort the array based on one or more columns. This method returns an ActiveRecord_Relation. Contact.all.order({ :last_name =&gt; :asc, :first_name =&gt; :asc, :date_of_birth =&gt; :desc }) Returns an ActiveRecord_Relation. The argument to .order is usually a Hash. The keys in the Hash must be Symbols that match names of columns in the table. These are the columns that will be used for sorting. If there are multiple keys, the order in which they are provided will be used to break ties. The value associated to each key must be either :asc (for ascending order) or :desc (for descending order). The argument to .order can also just be one Symbol, a column name. Contact.all.order(:last_name) In that case, :asc order is assumed. Full explanation B.2.6 .limit ActiveRecord_Relation#limit(Integer) ⇒ ActiveRecord_Relation Call .limit on an ActiveRecord_Relation to cap the number of records in the array. Returns an ActiveRecord_Relation. The argument to .limit must be an Integer. Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; &quot;Mouse&quot; }).limit(10) Full explanation B.2.7 .offset ActiveRecord_Relation#offset(Integer) ⇒ ActiveRecord_Relation Call .offset on an ActiveRecord_Relation to discard the first few records in the array: Returns an ActiveRecord_Relation. The argument to .offset must be an Integer. Contact.where({ :last_name =&gt; &quot;Mouse&quot; }).offset(10).limit(10) Full explanation B.2.8 .map_relation_to_array ActiveRecord_Relation#map_relation_to_array(Symbol) ⇒ Array Call .map_relation_to_array on an ActiveRecord_Relation to retrieve the values stored in just one column of the records, and discard all other data. .map_relation_to_array returns a regular Ruby Array of scalar values in the column. Not a single value, even if there was only one record in the ActiveRecord_Relation. Not an ActiveRecord_Relation, so you can no longer use methods like .where, .order, etc. You can use Array methods like .sort, .sample, etc. The argument to .map_relation_to_array must be a Symbol that matches the name of a column in the table. You cannot call .map_relation_to_array on an individual ActiveRecord row. If you want the value in a column for an individual row, simply call the accessor method directly: Contact.all.map_relation_to_array(:last_name) # =&gt; [&quot;Betina&quot;, &quot;Mouse&quot;, &quot;Woods&quot;] # for an array of records people.last_name # undefined method for array; bad people.map_relation_to_array(:last_name) # =&gt; [&quot;Betina&quot;, &quot;Woods&quot;]; good Full explanation B.2.9 .maximum ActiveRecord_Relation#maximum(Symbol) ⇒ Object Call .maximum on an ActiveRecord_Relation to grab and return the biggest value of a particular column. User.all.maximun(:age) # =&gt; 102 Returns a value from an ActiveRecord column. Full explanation B.2.10 .minimum ActiveRecord_Relation#minimum(Symbol) ⇒ Object Call .minimum on an ActiveRecord_Relation to grab and return the smallest value of a particular column. Photo.all.minimum(:caption) # =&gt; &quot;... a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.&quot; Returns a value from an ActiveRecord column. Full explanation B.2.11 .sum ActiveRecord_Relation#sum(Symbol) ⇒ Integer or ⇒ Float or ⇒ String Call .sum on an ActiveRecord_Relation to find the sum of the values in a single column: @poem.scores.sum(:points) Returns an Integer or Float (or even a String), depending on datatype of the column that was summed. The argument to .sum must be a Symbol that matches the name of a column in the table. Full explanation B.2.12 .average ActiveRecord_Relation#average(Symbol) ⇒ Integer or ⇒ Float Call .average on an ActiveRecord_Relation to find the mean of the values in a single column: @restaurant.reviews.average(:rating) Returns an Integer or Float, depending on datatype of the column that was averaged. The argument to .average must be a Symbol that matches the name of a column in the table. Full explanation "],["activerecord-a-single-record.html", "B.3 ActiveRecord (A single record)", " B.3 ActiveRecord (A single record) B.3.1 All column names You get a method for every column in the table; for example, if you have retrieved an individual record from the Contact table, you can call .first_name, .last_name, etc, on it. This means that every ActiveRecord object will have methods .id, .created_at, and .updated_at, since every table has those columns. Full explanation B.3.2 Any other instance methods you define in the class It’s often helpful to define your own instance methods in the model file; for example, you might want to define a method .full_name: class Contact &lt; ApplicationRecord def full_name return self.first_name + &quot; &quot; + self.last_name end end You would then be able to call .full_name anywhere in the application that you wind up with an individual Contact object.

It is annoying and error prone to, whenever I want the director associated with a movie, have to type d = Director.where({ :id =&gt; m.director_id }).at(0) Wouldn’t it be great if I could just type d = m.director and it would know how to go look up the corresponding row in the directors table based on the movie’s director_id? Unfortunately, I can’t, because .director isn’t a method that Movie objects automatically know how to perform — the method would be undefined. (Movie objects know how to perform .director_id because we get a method for every column in the table.) We could define such an instance method in the model ourselves without too much trouble. But, fortunately, since domain modeling and associations are at the heart of every application’s power, Rails gives us a shortcut. Go into the Movie model and add a line like this: belongs_to(:director, { :class_name =&gt; &quot;Director&quot;, :foreign_key =&gt; &quot;director_id&quot; }) This line tells Rails: belongs_to: We only one result (not an array of results). :director: Define a method called .director for all movie objects. :class_name =&gt; \"Director\": When someone invokes .director on a movie, go fetch a result from the directors table. :foreign_key =&gt; \"director_id\": Use the value in the director_id column of the movie to query the directors table for a row. This is exactly what we would do if we defined the instance method by hand: def director return Director.where({ :id =&gt; m.director_id }).at(0) end Either way, we now can utilize this handy shortcut anywhere in our application when we have a movie m and we want to get the record in the directors table associated with it: m.director Even better, if you’ve named your method and foreign key column conventionally (exactly matching the name of the other table), you can use the super-shorthand version: belongs_to(:director) If you omit specifying the :class_name, Rails assumes that the table that you want to query is named the same thing as the method you are defining. If you omit specifying the :foreign_key, Rails assumes that the foreign key column is named the same thing as the method plus _id. If either of those things happens to not be true, then just include the Hash as the second argument to belongs_to and spell it all out: belongs_to(:owner, { :class_name =&gt; &quot;User&quot;, :foreign_key =&gt; &quot;poster_id&quot; }) This would give us a method called .owner that returns a User, even though the foreign key column is called poster_id. We still have complete control, if we need to depart from conventional method/foreign key names for some reason.

This is both good and bad. It’s good because it lets us choose a style that we are most comfortable with, but it’s bad because we need to learn to at least recognize all of the styles so that we can read other people’s code. Here are a few optional syntax styles to become familiar with: "],["no-parentheses-around-arguments.html", "C.1 No parentheses around arguments", " C.1 No parentheses around arguments When we call a method that has arguments, we put the arguments within parentheses (()) immediately next to the method name (with no space between the method name and the opening parenthesis): &quot;hello&quot;.gsub(&quot;l&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;hezzo&quot; Ruby will allow you to, optionally, drop the parentheses around arguments: &quot;hello&quot;.gsub &quot;l&quot;, &quot;z&quot; # =&gt; &quot;hezzo&quot; It’s important to remember not to mix these two by putting a space before parentheses! # If you&#39;re going to use parens, don&#39;t also have a space &quot;hello&quot;.gsub (&quot;l&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) # bad I like to include the parentheses around arguments because it makes it clear what’s what, especially when you are chaining multiple methods together. The only time that I drop the parentheses is if I am using trivial methods at the beginning of a line, like p or ap: # Rather than p(&quot;Hi there&quot;) # I will usually do this instead: p &quot;Hi there&quot; "],["curly-braces-around-hash-arguments.html", "C.2 Curly braces around hash arguments", " C.2 Curly braces around hash arguments Consider a hypothetical method that accepts a Hash as its last argument: some_method(&quot;first_argument&quot;, 2, { :this =&gt; &quot;argument&quot;, :is =&gt; &quot;a Hash&quot; }) How many arguments does the above method have? You might be tempted to say four or even six if you just count, but really it’s three: a string is first, an integer is second, and the entire hash ({ :this =&gt; \"argument\", :is =&gt; \"a Hash\" }) is the third and final argument. In the case that a Hash literal is being used as the last argument to a method, you can optionally drop the curly braces around it: some_method(&quot;first_argument&quot;, 2, :this =&gt; &quot;argument&quot;, :is =&gt; &quot;a Hash&quot;) Now it really looks like the method is taking more than three arguments, but it’s not; Ruby can figure out from the hash rockets that the stuff at the end is really just one Hash. Note that you can only drop the curly braces around a Hash in this one, very specific case — if the Hash is the last argument to a method. So this: # Creating a Hash literal and storing it in a variable: my_hash = { :fruit =&gt; &quot;banana&quot;, :sport =&gt; &quot;hockey&quot; } is not the same as this: # The below is nonsensical, as far as Ruby is concerned: my_hash = :fruit =&gt; &quot;banana&quot;, :sport =&gt; &quot;hockey&quot; # You can&#39;t drop the curly braces around the Hash unless it is the last argument to a method. "],["new-hash-syntax.html", "C.3 New Hash Syntax", " C.3 New Hash Syntax Consider a Hash: { :fruit =&gt; &quot;banana&quot;, :sport =&gt; &quot;hockey&quot; } We can also (as of Ruby version 1.9) write the same thing as: { fruit: &quot;banana&quot;, sport: &quot;hockey&quot; } In other words, if the key in a key-value pair in a hash is a Symbol, you can move the colon (:) from the beginning of the symbol to the end of the symbol, and get rid of the hash rocket (=&gt;). This is known as the “new hash syntax” (even though Ruby 1.9 is pretty old by now). Consider the following Hash: { 1 =&gt; &quot;pink&quot;, 2 =&gt; &quot;cookies&quot; } Can we do the same trick and write this as: { 1: &quot;pink&quot;, 2: &quot;cookies&quot; } No! The “new” hash syntax is for when the keys are Symbols — then you can swing the Symbol’s colon around to the other side of it. "],["putting-it-all-together.html", "C.4 Putting it all together", " C.4 Putting it all together Consider a method that is designed like the following (very common in Rails); it has one or two arguments followed by a Hash in the last position: get(&quot;/photos&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;photos&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }) Since the keys are symbols, we can use the new hash syntax: get(&quot;/photos&quot;, { controller: &quot;photos&quot;, action: &quot;index&quot; }) Since the Hash is the final argument to the get() method, we can drop the curly braces: get(&quot;/photos&quot;, controller: &quot;photos&quot;, action: &quot;index&quot; ) And since there are no order-of-operations concerns, we can drop the parentheses around the arguments: get &quot;/photos&quot;, controller: &quot;photos&quot;, action: &quot;index&quot; Much more concise! Again, I personally prioritize readability far above brevity, so I like making things explicit rather than concise. However, when you are reading Ruby code out in the wild (on Stack Overflow or gem READMEs on GitHub), you will most often encounter code using all of these shortcuts, so you have to know how to read it. Most importantly, the Rails team has adopted the above optional syntaxes as their default, so when you’re reading the Rails Guides, you will often see things like this: class Holiday &lt; ApplicationRecord validates :name, uniqueness: { scope: :year, message: &quot;should happen once per year&quot; }, presence: true end Holy moly! What’s going on here? You just have to unwind each optional syntax one by one to get to something more familiar. First of all, they have dropped the parentheses around the arguments to the validates() method. We can replace them: class Holiday &lt; ApplicationRecord validates(:name, uniqueness: { scope: :year, message: &quot;should happen once per year&quot; }, presence: true) end Next: whenever you see a colon at the end of a token, you know it’s the new Hash syntax. So we can unwind it by moving the colons to the beginning and putting back the Hash rockets: class Holiday &lt; ApplicationRecord validates(:name, :uniqueness =&gt; { :scope =&gt; :year, :message =&gt; &quot;should happen once per year&quot; }, :presence =&gt; true) end Notice that I didn’t (and can’t) move the colon in :name — it’s already at the beginning, and this Symbol is not being used as the key in a Hash. It is simply the first argument to the validates method. Similarly, the Symbol:year is the value associated to the key :scope, so we leave it alone. Next: the second and last argument to the validates() method is a Hash with two keys (:uniqueness and :presence), so the Rails Guides dropped the curly braces around it. We can put them back: class Holiday &lt; ApplicationRecord validates(:name, { :uniqueness =&gt; { :scope =&gt; :year, :message =&gt; &quot;should happen once per year&quot; }, :presence =&gt; true }) end We might also take advantage of whitespace to indent more helpfully: class Holiday &lt; ApplicationRecord validates( :name, { :uniqueness =&gt; { :scope =&gt; :year, :message =&gt; &quot;should happen once per year&quot; }, :presence =&gt; true } ) end Now that we’ve fully unwound the optional syntaxes, it’s easier to see that: The validates() method is taking two arguments; the first is a Symbol and the second is a Hash. The value associated with the :uniqueness key is itself another, nested, Hash: { :scope =&gt; :year, :message =&gt; \"should happen once per year\" }. That Hash has two keys in it: :scope and :message. We cannot drop the curly braces around { :scope =&gt; :year, :message =&gt; \"should happen once per year\" } because it is not the last argument to a method — it is the value associated to the key :uniqueness in a parent hash. If we tried to drop them, we’ll run into problems: class Holiday &lt; ApplicationRecord validates(:name, { :uniqueness =&gt; :scope =&gt; :year, :message =&gt; &quot;should happen once per year&quot;, :presence =&gt; true }) end Ruby can’t make sense of :uniqueness =&gt; :scope =&gt; :year, and can’t tell which things are in the inner hash vs. the outer hash. So: don’t fret when you see seemingly unfamiliar syntax like scope: :year — it’s nothing new, it’s just a different style. You’ve got the tools you need to understand any Ruby you encounter.

However, it’s a very common style so you should get used to figuring out which one it is from the context. If the curly braces are next to a method and there are no key/value pairs, then it’s a block, not a Hash. This style is most often used when chaining more methods: numbers = [8, 3, 1, 4, 3, 9] numbers.select { |num| num &gt; 3 }.sort # =&gt; [4, 8, 9] Ruby wants developers to be happy, so it gives them lots of options — this is a double-edged sword! It means we can be expressive, but it also means we need to be able to parse many different styles when reading other people’s writing.

These titles are not displayed in the browser window, but they are used as the page name by search engines and displayed by browsers in the title bar, on the page tab, and as the page name of bookmarked webpages. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;HTML Reference&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; This is a whole HTML page. &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; With the addition of &lt;title&gt;, we now have a complete, valid HTML document. D.4.5.2 meta The meta tag is used to add machine-readable information to an HTML page. These tags always go in the head tag and are typically used to specify information about the content of the page. For example, page description, keywords, author of the document, or type of characters used. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;HTML Reference&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;John Doe&quot;&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; This is a whole HTML page. &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; D.4.5.3 link The link tag defines a link between a document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to define the relationship between a document and one or more external CSS stylesheets. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;HTML Reference&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;theme.css&quot;&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; This is a whole HTML page. &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; "],["html-cheatsheet.html", "E HTML Cheatsheet", " E HTML Cheatsheet Notes: Copied from html-cheatsheet.md "],["basic-syntax.html", "E.1 Basic Syntax", " E.1 Basic Syntax An HTML page is made up of elements. An element is constructed from an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The general structure looks like: &lt;tagname&gt;Content goes here...&lt;/tagname&gt; tagname is a not a real HTML tag, but a placeholder for any HTML tag. E.1.1 Attributes An attribute specifies additional information about the element. One or more attributes can be added inside the opening tag after the tag name. Attributes are usually structured as name/value pairs in the format name=\"value\". For example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt; Go to Wikipedia &lt;/a&gt; Most attributes only make sense on specific elements. For example: - href=\"\" is for &lt;a&gt; elements, to specify where to take the user when they click the link. - src=\"\" is for &lt;img&gt; elements, to specify the url of the image to load. - for=\"\" is for &lt;label&gt; elements, to specify which input element it is paired with. Some attributes can be put on almost any element, like class=\"\" or id=\"\". ​Any single id should only be used once per document. A class can and should be used repeatedly. E.1.2 Exceptions There are a few elements that don’t require content and therefore don’t have a closing tag. The most common ones are: - &lt;img&gt; - &lt;input&gt; - &lt;br&gt; - &lt;hr&gt; - &lt;meta&gt; - &lt;link&gt; E.1.3 Nesting Elements Elements can contain other elements. When that happens, the one inside is known as a child element and the one outside is the parent element. If there are multiple levels of nesting, then all the elements inside an outer element are its descendants. Similarly, an element that contains other elements is referred to as an ancestor. "],["required-elements.html", "E.2 Required Elements", " E.2 Required Elements There are required elements that every HTML page must have to be considered valid, according to W3 HTML specifications. You can paste any HTML into the W3C Validator to verify that your document is valid. E.2.1 Doctype Declaration &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; This must be the very first line in the file. It instructs the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. E.2.2 &lt;html&gt; element &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt; The &lt;html&gt; element is the ancestor of every other HTML element on the page (except for the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration). It contains exactly two other elements: &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;. E.2.3 &lt;head&gt; element &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;/html&gt; This element contains information and instructions for the browser on how to process the document; things like what title or icon to put in the browser tab, what style sheets to load, what language to use, etc. E.2.4 &lt;title&gt; element &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;HTML Cheatsheet&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;/html&gt; This element is used to assign a title to an HTML document.

To make them easy to identify, perhaps name them descriptively: [first name]-[last-initial]-profile.jpg [first name]-[last-initial]-cover.png [first name]-[last-initial]-1.png [first name]-[last-initial]-2.jpg [first name]-[last-initial]-3.png Then, add them into your document using the img tag: &lt;img src=&quot;images/whatever.jpg&quot;&gt; Or, if it’s located somewhere out on the internet rather than in our own code: &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.somewhere.com/whatever.jpg&quot;&gt; F.2.4 Tables Let’s put your experience data into a table. In HTML, the &lt;table&gt; element is used to represent two dimensional data. A simple table looks like this: &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;First&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Last&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;John&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Doe&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Jane&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Doe&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; which would produce this: First Last John Doe Jane Doe The things to keep in mind about tables are: Every piece of data must reside within a cell, a &lt;td&gt; (table data) element. Every &lt;td&gt; element must reside within a row, a &lt;tr&gt; element. Every &lt;tr&gt; must have the same number of cells, or things get out of whack. Despite this last rule, you can, however, “merge” cells using the colspan attribute: &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;People&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;John&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Doe&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Jane&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Doe&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; produces: People John Doe Jane Doe You can see that we’ve merged two cells in the first row together; the colspan=\"2\" on the first cell ensures that we don’t violate the “every &lt;tr&gt; must have the same number of cells” rule.
