They are distinguished by the user needs: study (“Tutorial”) vs. work (“HowTo”). Tutorials provide a learning experience, how-to-guides help the user accomplish a task. For us, the line is blurry, but a breakdown could be that any gitpod and other videos are “Tutorials” and the written accompaniment is a “HowTo”.
