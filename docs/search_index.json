At a minimum, we needed to install: An application to write your code with. Something like Microsoft Word is not be ideal for writing code, since code needs to be plain text (just a series of characters in a file, nothing else) for the computer to understand it. Word is designed to write rich text (for humans) with fonts, colors, sizes, margins, layouts, etc. Computers come bundled with some plain text editors (Notepad, TextEdit, etc) but they are very basic. We would instead prefer to use powerful tools specifically designed for writing code with like Microsoft’s VSCode or JetBrains’ RubyMine. Ruby itself. Writing code is not useful on its own if we don’t have something to run it with; just like we need a browser installed to interpret .html files we need Excel installed to interpret .xls files, and we need Photoshop installed to interpret .ps files, we need Ruby installed in order to interpret the .rb files that we write. Not only that, we need the correct version installed. If your computer happened to come with an older version, upgrading to a newer version could be complicated — especially if some other application you use depends on the older version. There are so many different combinations of hardware, operating systems, previously installed software, permission levels (for example if you are using a work-owned computer), that just getting these things installed would often stop you before you started writing your first program. We can’t allow that! Instead, we’re going to use a write our code using a cloud computer. “Cloud” just means that it’s a computer that’s sitting in someone’s warehouse1 somewhere, and we rent it from them. It already has all of the software that we need installed on it, and we access it through our browsers. No muss, no fuss! Gitpod.io is a great new service that provides instantaneous, full-fledged cloud development environments from any codebase that is on GitHub.com — which is great, because we (and 98% of other teams) use GitHub to store all of our projects, homeworks, etc. The text editor they provide is based on Microsoft’s VSCode — my editor of choice. It will have the exact right version of Ruby, Rails, and everything else we need. And they have a very generous free tier. Great! Sign up for a Gitpod.io account. It will ask you to sign in using your GitHub account. We will create a workspace for each project that we work on. Each workspace is based on a GitHub repository (i.e., a folder with some code in it). For example, here is a repository: https://github.com/appdev-projects/helloruby To create a Gitpod workspace based on a repo, in the address bar of your browser enter https://gitpod.io/# and then the URL of the repo. For example, https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/appdev-projects/helloruby To make that process easier, Gitpod has a browser extension that you can install if you want to. Typically, we will assign you a project in Canvas. The assignment will include a button that says “Load assignment in a new window”. When you click on that button, it will create a fork (i.e. a copy) of the repository (i.e. the folder of code) on your own GitHub account. You will then create a Gitpod workspace2 based on your fork, so that you can save the work that you do back to your own GitHub account. A button to create your Gitpod workspace will appear within the assignment, so usually all you need to do is click on it after clicking “Load assignment in a new window”. And then you can get right to work, with the exact right version of all of the project’s dependencies ready to go! 3.2.2 Forcing Chrome to “Hard” Refresh Sometimes, when we update a CSS stylesheet, our page appears not to change. This is especially frequent when we’re working on static HTML files in the public/ folder. The cause is usually Chrome’s aggressive “caching”, i.e. re-using static assets that it has already downloaded (for performance reasons). If we refresh an HTML page that we’ve updated, Chrome won’t necessarily also refresh all &lt;link&gt;ed CSS files — unless we ask it to by “hard” refreshing. To do so: Open the Dev Tools… from the View &gt; Developer menu or right-click on any element and Inspect or press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+J (on Windows) or Option+Command+J (on Mac) Right-click on the refresh button. Select “Empty cache and hard reload”. Open Dev Tools: With Dev Tools open, “hard” refresh: Your HTML document should now have the latest CSS and any other linked assets (like images or javascripts). 3.2.3 Gitpod keyboard shortcuts and other productivity tips 3.2.3.1 Important Terminal keystrokes to know 3.2.3.1.1 Jump to beginning of line You can’t use your mouse at the command line, so it’s important to know how to move around quickly so you’re not restricted to just using your arrows. Jump back to the beginning of the line with Ctrl + A: 3.2.3.1.2 Jump to end of line Mac OS, Windows: Ctrl + E 3.2.3.1.3 Up and down arrows to scroll through your history Use your up and down arrows to scroll through your command history so that you don’t have to re-type your commands over and over. 3.2.3.1.4 Clear Terminal Mac OS: Command + K Windows: Disabled by default3 From the menu open Preferences and select Keyboard shortcuts. Then search for “terminal clear” in the search bar and click the plus icon to the left of it. Finally, type ctrl + k and Enter to confirm. 3.2.3.1.5 Interrupt command If something goes wrong with a terminal program (i.e. you made a typo, a program gets stuck in an infinite loop, etc), you can generally interrupt it with Ctrl + C: 3.2.3.1.6 Q to exit When the output of a terminal command is too tall for a terminal tab to display at once, it paginates. Press Space to step through it one page at a time, or Q to quit and get back to the terminal prompt so that you can execute your next command. Mac OS, Windows: Q 3.2.3.2 Editor keyboard shortcuts 3.2.3.2.1 Command Palette The most important thing to memorize is how to open the Command Palette, which will allow you to fuzzy search within for all other commands. If the command has a keyboard shortcut mapped to it, the shortcut will be displayed to the right. This is the best way to learn the keyboard shortcuts for the commands that you use most frequently. Mac OS: Command + Shift + P Windows: Ctrl + Shift + P 3.2.3.2.2 Quick open file To quickly jump to a file: Mac OS: Command + P Windows: Ctrl + P And then fuzzily search for its name. For example, you could type “phco” to get to photos_controller.rb and the list would quickly narrow to bring that file to the top of the list. 3.2.3.2.3 Toggle Code Comment To quickly comment a line of code, put your cursor on that line and then: Mac OS: Command + / Windows: Ctrl + / You can also highlight multiple lines of code and comment/uncomment all of them at once. 3.2.3.2.4 Find (and replace) Mac OS: Command + F Windows: Ctrl + F 3.2.3.2.5 Find Next Selection Mac OS: Command + D Windows: Ctrl + D If you go too far by mistake, you can step backwards with Command + U or Ctrl + U. 3.2.3.2.6 Move line Mac OS: Option + ⬇ Windows: Alt + ⬇ 3.2.3.2.7 Duplicate line Mac OS: Shift + Option + ⬇ Windows: Shift + Alt + ⬇ 3.2.3.2.8 Add/Remove Tab spaces for multiple lines Mac OS: (Shift) + Tab Windows: (Shift) + Tab 3.2.3.2.9 Add More Cursors Mac OS: Option + Click Windows: Alt + Click 3.2.3.2.10 Embedded Ruby (ERB) Tag Toggle Mac OS, Windows: Ctrl + Shift + ` 3.2.3.2.11 Toggle Terminal Panel Mac OS: Command + J Windows: Ctrl + J 3.2.3.2.12 Open New Terminal Mac OS: Ctrl + ~ (i.e. Ctrl + Shift + `) Windows: Ctrl + ~ (i.e. Ctrl + Shift + `) A warehouse full of computers that people rent and connect to via the internet is called a “data center”. Some data centers have their own power plants, and some are even earthquake-proofed.↩︎ Gitpod will delete an inactive workspace after 14 days. If you want to save the changes you’ve made for longer, you can “pin” a workspace in Gitpod which will prevent it from being deleted. Even better, you can push your changes to Github.↩︎ A recent Gitpod update removed this keyboard shortcut for Windows, so you’ll need to configure it yourself.↩︎ "],["git.html", "3.3 Git", " 3.3 Git Notes: sections from using-git-to-experiement-and-save-work.md 3.3.1 What Git is Git is an extremely powerful version-control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, which is one of the largest open-source software projects in existence. It makes it possible for large numbers of contributors to work on various features, all within a single codebase (which could be comprised of hundreds or thousands of files). Bitbucket, GitLab, and especially GitHub (all private companies) rode the rise of Git (the protocol) to become the center of the software development universe. All of these companies basically offer cloud-based storage for codebases using Git for version-control (we refer to these codebases as repositories), as well as a web-based interface for collaborating on them — following, commenting, etc. 3.3.2 Why we care In this course, we’re going to use one simple but effective Git-based workflow to save versions of our work. This will allow us to freely experiment with different approaches, while never having to throw away code. In all of our Rails apps, after you start the server, you can navigate to the address /git in your live application. If you’re using Gitpod, the URL will look like: https://[YOUR GITPOD WORKSPACE URL].gitpod.io/git That will open a page that looks like this: As soon as you make any changes to any of the code in the project, and refresh this page, the lines that you changed will appear: On the left, you see the code as it was previously; on the right, you see the new code. Lines added are highlighted in green, lines removed are highlighted in red. Below, there are two things you can do: commit your changes on the left, and switch to a new branch on the right. When you hear the word “commit”, think “snapshot”. When you hear the word “branch”, think “version”. A Git commit is a snapshot of all of the folders and files in your project at a particular time. Since our files of code are all interdependent, it doesn’t make sense to save versions of individual files — we need to know the entire state of the project for a version to be useful. Each branch (“version”) is a series of commits (“snapshots”). The most important thing for you to remember is simple: commit early and commit often. As long as you are taking snapshots of your work at various points, it will always be easy to get back to a previous state in case you want to start over and explore a different approach. To commit, enter a title for the snapshot (required), and, optionally, a longer description: After you commit, you will no longer have any pending changes: If you edit your code again, then you can make further commits. Fundamentally, that’s all you need to worry about: just make lots of commits as you work. The best time to commit is right after you just got something to work, before you start on your next experiment. Remember: ABC: Always Be Committing. 3.3.3 Jumping back in time In the History dialog at the bottom, you can see a list of all of the commits you’ve made. If you want to jump back in time to one of them, copy the 7 letter code (known as the “hash” of the commit; it is a unique identifier) in front of it into the “Branch off of” field above. Pick a name for a new version, and click “Create a new branch off of…”. It will snap all of the files in the project back to that point in time, and you can now make further commits along a new path — while still retaining all of your old commits on the old path. You can easily jump to any commit from any branch at any time — so feel free to experiment! Make a commit to save your current work, then jump back to a previous commit to try a different approach. 3.3.4 Switch to a Different Branch Have you gone back in time and decided your first attempt was better? Turn your attention to the “Existing Branches” panel on the right. This will list any branches your project has— master is the default starting branch. To switch to a different branch, click the blue double arrow button next to the name of the branch you want to switch to. If you’re ever unsure of what branch you’re on, the top of the page should list “On branch ___”. 3.3.5 Push to GitHub Gitpod workspaces are not permanent. Even if we make git commits, if the workspace is deleted so is all of our work! This is where GitHub comes in. We can push all of the commits we’ve made to our repository on GitHub where it will live forever. If our Gitpod workspace gets destroyed we can just re-create another one from the latest commit on GitHub! Before you can push to GitHub, you need to give Gitpod access. Head over to the Integrations under your account settings in Gitpod and make sure you check “public repos” and click “Update”. This should open a GitHub authorization dialogue. Make sure to click “Grant” next to the GitHub organization you created for class Now you should be all set to push your commits to GitHub!

Also, don’t forget to check your email and verify the address you entered. For now, think of GitHub like Dropbox-for-programmers; it’s where we’re going to store all of our code. 3.4.1.2 Create GitHub organization To keep things organized, we’re going to create a separate GitHub organization account for you to store your AppDev projects under (to keep them separate from the personal projects that you’ll hopefully be building soon!). Click the + on the right side of the navbar and select “New organization”: Choose any name for the organization; most students choose [YOUR USERNAME]-appdev. In this example screenshot, I chose demolearner1-appdev: You can “Skip” or “Finish” the rest of the screens: 3.4.1.3 Login to Canvas Open up the Assignments tab and make sure they’re sorted by type. Scroll down to the assignment you want to start and click the link that says ‘Load [your assignment name] in a new window’ (the name of the project will vary). Before you click “Authorize”, make sure to click the “Grant” button next to the organization that you created earlier. Only then, click authorize to allow the firstdraft Grades application to access your account. Select the name of your GitHub organization and submit the form. The next screen will ask you to accept an invitation to a GitHub team. You can click the link on that screen to accept, or you’ll have an invitation in your email inbox as well. Once you’ve joined, you should see feedback that you’re now a member of appdev-projects: 3.4.1.4 Daily workflow The stuff above about setting up your organization and permissions was just a one-time thing. From now on, you’ll just head to Canvas and click “Load assignment in a new tab”. You should see something like the following (the name of the project will vary): We will automatically make a copy (a “fork”, in GitHub parlance) of the repository under your new GitHub organization. Then, you can choose to either “Create new workspace in Gitpod” or head to your “Gitpod Dashboard” to view existing workspaces. Either way, once you’re in the workspace, we can get the project loaded up and try out the feedback feature. After the bin/setup script is done running, start working on the project to do whatever the instructions tell you. When you’re ready for feedback, try a new command at a new Terminal prompt: rails grade You’ll be asked for your access token; copy-paste it carefully from the grades.firstdraft.com page that you loaded from Canvas. You should see output that looks like: Copy-paste the Results URL into a new tab, or click on it (but make sure it isn’t truncated). (Some projects aren’t graded; in that case there may only be one dummy test listed.) You can click on one of the tests to get more feedback on what might have gone wrong: In this case, the test expected to find an element with a class of word_count that contains the number 10, but instead it only found the content “Replace this string with your answer”. You can click the “Examine Test” button to read the actual Ruby of the automated test; it’s surprisingly readable. Ruby’s testing libraries use method names that are supposed to make tests readable even for non-technical managers and clients. You can see specifically what flow is being tested and what inputs are being used and what the expected output is, and try to reproduce the issue in your own app manually using the same inputs. You can run rails grade in your Terminal as many times as you want, and you will get a new updated build report each time. It will only report your highest score back to Canvas. Remember that your first job is always to make your app work as described and test it manually yourself. You should not rely exclusively on the automated tests; they are a terrible way to debug. 3.4.2 Fixing your organization permissions Once upon a time, we all created our own GitHub organizations to keep our classwork separate from our personal projects. Since then, whenever we gave permission to a third-party (like Gitpod or grades.firstdraft.com) to access our GitHub accounts, we were supposed to remember to grant access to our organization too. If you forgot to click “Grant” next to the organization that you created before you clicked “Authorize”, you’re going to run into problems. Let’s fix it. Go to GitHub and sign in. In this example, I am signed in as the user demolearner1. Click on the user icon in the top-right and find “Settings”: Next, click on “Organizations” in the left sidebar: Find the organization that you created. You likely picked a name like [YOUR USERNAME]-appdev: Next, go to the Settings of the organization: In the left sidebar, find “Third-party access”: If it says that you approved both, then you are good to go and you can go to the next section. If neither Cloud9 nor Grades appears in this list, click the “Remove restrictions” button instead and you can go to the next section. If it says that access is Denied next to Cloud9 or Grades, then proceed. Click on whichever one you denied and Grant Access: You should see a message confirming that access has been granted: Repeat for the other third-party app if necessary. 3.4.2.1 Make sure that you’ve accepted your team invitation Visit this page and make sure that you don’t have a banner across the top asking you to accept our team invitation. (This invitation was sent a while ago via email; if you’ve already accepted it, the banner won’t appear.) 3.4.2.2 Launch an assignment from within Canvas Head back to Canvas and click on whichever assignment you want to work on again (don’t just refresh it if you already had it up). You might be asked to enter your organization name — be sure to enter your organization name, the one you created; not appdev-projects. 3.4.2.3 Resetting OAuth permissions to square one If for some reason you need to make a single-sign-on provider (like GitHub, Twitter, or Facebook) “forget” that you ever authorized a third-party app, maybe because you don’t use it anymore or maybe because you want to change the permissions that you gave it, you need to delete or revoke the “access token” that you previously issued to it. In the case of GitHub, go to your personal settings: Find “Applications” in the left sidebar: Click the “Authorized OAuth Apps” tab and then click “Revoke” next to whichever one you want to “forget”: Then, return to the third-party app and “Sign in with…” again to start over from scratch. In our case, click on an assignment from within Canvas again to re-start the authorization process — and this time don’t forget to grant access to the organization that you created. 3.4.3 Sharing a Gitpod Snapshot It’s often helpful to share a snapshot of the state of your entire Gitpod workspace with someone else. 3.4.3.1 Take the snapshot From the hamburger menu in the top-left corner of your IDE, select Gitpod: Share Workspace Snapshot: 3.4.3.2 Copy the snapshot URL It will take a moment to create the snapshot. Then a dialog will pop up in the bottom-right corner that will give you the URL to copy and share: 3.4.3.2.1 The correct URL looks like this The URL that you share should look something like this: https://gitpod.io#snapshot/5a47e40d-e279-44e5-96bc-ae33cd48f151 Note the #snapshot fragment of the URL. That means you have the right one. 3.4.3.2.2 Not this The URL should not look something like this: https://ac1bde40-34e8-421d-a102-6425971fb9db.ws-eu38.gitpod.io/ That is the URL of your own IDE, which no one else can access. 3.4.3.2.3 Or this The URL should not look something like this: https://3000-ac1bde40-34e8-421d-a102-6425971fb9db.ws-eu38.gitpod.io Note the 3000- at the start. That is the URL of the live preview of your app. 3.4.3.3 Snapshots are completely independent When someone clicks on the snapshot URL, they will get their own private copy of your workspace in the state that it was in when you took the snapshot. Any changes they make to their copy will not affect your workspace. Similarly, any changes you make to your workspace won’t affect their snapshot. So you can keep trying to resolve the problem on your own, or work on the next task, without interfering with their snapshot.

The only place you can include a URL is in your bio, and you can only include one. This soon led to a trend of people promoting something with a post, but including “Link in bio!” in the caption. They would then update the solitary link in their bio to the latest thing they wanted to promote. Soon, a bunch of services cropped up that allow people to manage multiple links in a single, mobile-friendly page; and include a link to that page in their bio. The most popular of these is Linktree, but there are many others. Linktree has many users, from media companies to celebrities to, most likely, some of your friends — and maybe even you? Here are some examples: HBO’s Instagram bio: And HBO’s list of links: Katy Perry’s Instagram bio: And Katy Perry’s list of links: In this project, we’re going to build our own mobile-friendly list of links that we can include in our social media profiles or anywhere else that we like. Here’s mine: There are several benefits to writing our own rather than using a service like Linktree: We can use our own custom domain name for it; rather than linktree.com/raghubetina, notice that my URL is simply rag.hu. We don’t have to pay. Linktree has a free tier with limited design options, but if you want access to the fun themes, analytics, or to remove the Linktree branding, you have to subscribe to their $5/mo or $9/mo plan. We have all the power of CSS at our fingerprints to customize the design. Linktree, like all “no code” tools, limits you to a set of pre-defined constraints that you have to work within. Not so if you’re writing the code yourself. For example, if you click through to mine, you’ll notice a lot of touches that aren’t available options even on the paid Linktree plans: an animated background, a “frosted glass” effect on the links, etc. It’s just plain fun! Let’s get started. "],["getting-started.html", "9.1 Getting started", " 9.1 Getting started We’re going to start our projects a little differently this time. Rather than clicking the “Load [assignment] in a new window” button in Canvas, which usually will automatically create your copy of the repository on your organization, you will manually create your own blank Rails app (the same steps you can follow any time you want to build your own, non-assigned projects): Visit our appdev-projects/base-rails repository and click the “Use this template” button. Then select “Create new repository” from the dropdown. On the next screen, leave the “Owner” dropdown alone. For “Repository name”, enter “your-username.github.io”. Substitute your own, real username for your-username. So, for example, my repo name is “raghubetina.github.io”. Make sure to include the “.github.io” part in the repo name. E.g.: Click “Create new repository from template”. Create a new Gitpod workspace based on your brand new repository: In a new tab’s address bar, type “gitpod.io/#”. Then copy-paste the URL of your new repository after that. The URL should look something like gitpod.io/#https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io Press return to visit that URL and Gitpod will automatically start creating a new workspace for you. Once you’re in to your new workspace, bin/server at a terminal tab as usual to start up your web server. Open your app preview in a new tab. Create a file called index.html in the public/ folder.

Unsplash is a great resource for high quality stock images if you don’t want to use an image of yourself. The URLs of your social media profiles.

Here are some examples that you can peruse for inspiration. A thumbnail image for each link. I used a few strategies to find an image for each link: Search Google images and look for one hosted on wikimedia.org. Searched Unsplash for a relevant image. Generate an image with AI. I downloaded the image and then uploaded it to my Gitpod workspace by drag-and-dropping it into the public/ folder. If you want to, you can use fake placeholder images and links for everything, but I encourage you to gather real content.

I wrapped each block of content in a &lt;div&gt; for now, to create some separation.

Two things to notice: I’m using the target=\"_blank\" attribute on any links that I want to open in a new tab. For images that I am serving from my own public/ folder: I created a subfolder called thumbnails to help keep things organized, and moved the images there. When referencing the URL of the image in a src=\"\" attribute, I start with a leading slash — e.g.: &lt;img src=&quot;/thumbnails/typography.jpg&quot;&gt; I do not include /public in the URL. At this stage, your page technically serves its purpose — a collection of links people can click on — but it probably looks terrible, like this. "],["html-validator.html", "9.4 HTML Validator", " 9.4 HTML Validator If at any point your HTML breaks, or you suspect you e.g. forgot a closing tag but can’t find it, the W3C HTML Validator might come in handy. Paste in your entire HTML document and click “Check”, and it will give you a list of feedback. Some of them are yellow warnings and can be safely ignored for now, but any critical mistakes (like missing closing tags or quotation marks) will show up as red errors. For example, if you run your HTML through the validator right now (try it), it will display a bunch of errors because we don’t have alt=\"\" attributes on our &lt;img&gt;s. These are important to include for accessibility reasons, and just in case the image breaks for some reason (i.e. the URL changes). We should add descriptive alternative text for each image.

"],["sizing-images.html", "9.6 Sizing images", " 9.6 Sizing images Now, let’s start to make the page look better. Let’s add a &lt;style&gt; element inside the &lt;head&gt; of the document so that we can begin applying CSS. We won’t use an external stylesheet for now, since we’re only planning to apply this CSS to a single page. Maybe we can start by giving the body some breathing room with top and bottom padding: &lt;style&gt; body { padding-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 40px; } &lt;/style&gt; Let’s start by sizing the profile picture. We need to give it a class so that we can apply CSS rules to it — let’s call it banner-image: &lt;div class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;profile-pic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Raghu Betina headshot&quot; class=&quot;banner-image&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Then, let’s make the banner image 128 pixels by 128 pixels: &lt;style&gt; .banner-image { width: 128px; height: 128px; } &lt;/style&gt; Unless your original image was exactly square, this probably will look squished when you check out the results. To solve this problem, we can use the object-fit property: .banner-image { width: 128px; height: 128px; object-fit: cover; } It’s quite common to see circular profile pictures. If you want to, set a large border-radius to achieve that: .banner-image { width: 128px; height: 128px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 128px; } I didn’t use one on my profile picture, but you should feel free to get creative with borders, as well. Similarly, let’s size all of the thumbnail images as 48px by 48px: .thumbnail { width: 48px; height: 48px; border-radius: 48px; object-fit: cover; } Don’t forget to add the class to the relevant &lt;img&gt; elements. Now, your page should look something like this — much better. "],["basic-colors.html", "9.7 Basic colors", " 9.7 Basic colors Let’s add some color to make it easier to see how much space each element is occupying. We’ll, at a minimum, need a color for the background of the entire page and for each link. You can come up with your own palette, or you can use Happy Hues, a nice set of curated color palettes. I used this palette. I used the background color, headline color, button color, and button text color like this: body { background-color: #004643; } .name { color: #fffffe; } .social-icons a { color: #fffffe; text-decoration: none; } .link { background-color: #f9bc60; } .link a { color: #001e1d; text-decoration: none; } As you can see, I also removed the underlines from links with text-decoration: none. Notice that I used the descendant combinator: .link a { /* ... */ } This selector targets only &lt;a&gt; elements that are descendants of elements with class link. This is a handy alternative to adding a new class to all of the elements I’m interested in targeting.4 My page now looks like this. If you want to become a pro at writing CSS selectors, I recommend an interactive tutorial/game called CSS Diner. If you make it through all 32 levels, you’ll be better than most front-end developers at writing advanced CSS selectors. In addition to making it easier to style your own pages, knowing how to write advanced selectors will pay dividends if you’re interested in doing any web scraping.↩︎ "],["layout.html", "9.8 Layout", " 9.8 Layout Now, for the interesting part — laying out the elements where we want them on the page. 9.8.1 Overall page layout Since this is a relatively simple, single-column layout, we could stay in the normal flow mode and achieve most of the positioning that we want with margin and padding. But let’s use display: flex instead. It will make it much easier to do things like vertically center the text within each link’s box. First, I’ll wrap all of our content — the div.banner, the div.name, the div.social-icons, and all of the div.links — within a new parent &lt;div&gt; with a class called items. This will make it easier for me to position and size everything uniformly. Then I will switch the layout mode of the new div.items from the default normal flow to flex: .items { display: flex; } If you try that and refresh your page, you’ll see that all of the elements are now horizontally side-by-side. This is because the default flex-direction is row. Let’s switch the flex-direction to column to lay them out vertically again: .items { display: flex; flex-direction: column; } If you refresh, you’ll see the layout is vertical again. When we’re using display: flex mode, we can use the gap property to provide some breathing room between each child element, rather than having to add margin: .items { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 30px; } On laptop screens, the buttons are running all the way to the edge of the screen, which isn’t very attractive. Let’s set a max-width of around 640px (you choose a value that looks good to you): .items { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 30px; max-width: 640px; } 9.8.2 Layout for each link Within each link, it would be nice if: The thumbnail and text were vertically centered within the box. The text was horizontally centered in the space remaining next to the thumbnail. display: flex to the rescue! 9.8.2.1 Vertically centering with align-items We can vertically center child elements with the align-items property: .link { background-color: #f9bc60; display: flex; align-items: center; } If you refresh, the thumbnails should be lined up nicely with the link text. 9.8.2.2 flex-grow Next, let’s center the text of each link. I’m going to expand the existing rule that we have for .link a. Can we simply add text-align: center and call it a day? .link a { color: #001e1d; text-decoration: none; text-align: center; } If you refresh, you’ll see that didn’t work. Why? To make it easier to see things while I am working on layouts, I often use the following hack: * { border: thin red solid; } This puts a thin red border around every element. Your page should now look something like this: We can see that the &lt;a&gt; elements are only just wide enough to fit their content, so centering within them isn’t doing anything. Instead, we want the &lt;a&gt; element to occupy all of the available space to the right of the thumbnail. To achieve, this we can use the flex-grow property: .link a { color: #001e1d; text-decoration: none; text-align: center; flex-grow: 1; } Now the &lt;a&gt; element grows to fill any available space, while the &lt;img&gt; element stays the same size (it still has the default value for flex-grow, which is 0). And our text should be nicely centered since we already added the text-align. 9.8.2.3 justify-content Now let’s take care of centering the profile picture and name, as well as putting some breathing room between the social links. Flexbox has a wonderful property called justify-content that will help with all of these things: .name { color: #fffffe; display: flex; justify-content: center; } .banner { display: flex; justify-content: center; } .social-icons { display: flex; justify-content: space-around; } You could also use the same technique to center the div.items within the &lt;body&gt;: body { display: flex; justify-content: center; } But then we again need to tell the child elements to grow to take up all available space with flex-grow: .items { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 30px; max-width: 640px; flex-grow: 1; } Our page layout should now look solid! Let’s add a little bit of padding inside our div.links: .link { background-color: #f9bc60; display: flex; align-items: center; padding: 5px; } It should now be safe to remove the * { border: thin red solid; } hack, unless you want to continue playing with layout, padding, etc. Our page now looks something like this. "],["deploy.html", "9.9 Deploy!", " 9.9 Deploy! We’ve made a lot of progress, and our list of links is functional and looking pretty solid! We can and will spend more time fine-tuning, but this seems like a great time to deploy our app to industrial-grade hosting so that we can actually link to it in our bios! Sadly, after over a decade, Heroku’s free tier was eliminated as of November 28th, 2022. There are some silver linings — they have launched a new discount through GitHub Student, and they created a couple of new, less expensive plans (Eco, Basic, Mini). For full-stack, dynamic, interactive, database-backed apps, I plan to still use Heroku. However, Heroku is no longer a good choice for hosting static HTML websites. There are several other free and fast options for that (e.g. Netlify and Vercel). Today, I want to show you GitHub’s offering for hosting static websites: GitHub Pages. We will deploy our Link In Bio via GitHub Pages. This will have several benefits: It’s free. It is tightly integrated with GitHub repositories (obviously), so all we need to do to deploy is what we do anyway — make a commit and push to GitHub . It doesn’t have any of Heroku’s old free tier’s restrictions. It will be up 24/7/365. It automatically includes SSL for custom domains (important if you’re using a top-level domain that requires https, like .dev). GitHub Pages sites are automatically assigned a subdomain under .github.io. This carries some developer cred. Or you can easily use your own domain. Here’s what to do to get your first GitHub Pages site going: Visit /git. Make a commit and then push the changes you’ve made so far to your GitHub repository. That’s it! In a few minutes, your site should be live at https://your-username.github.io! Eventually, consider adding some other pages to your site besides just index.html — a list of projects that you’ve built, for example. If you want to use a custom domain name like yourname.com rather than something like your-username.github.io, then you’ll first have to purchase a domain. I recommend Porkbun, or, for more exotic top-level domains, Gandi.net. Here is a guide to adding your own domain to your Pages site. Let me know if you get stuck.

We’re now especially proficient in writing Ruby programs, especially with the aid of gems and APIs. BENP: have we discussed gems and APIs up to this point though? However, if we (the developers) are the only ones that can run these programs (from the command line through the ruby interpreter), then they aren’t much use. It’s time to start adding a web interface on top of our Ruby programs so that external users can interact with and benefit from them. We already have all the tools to build our first dynamic web application. BENP: need to clearly define RCAV early in any video or document now so we aren’t left wondering, added next sentence. Before we begin building, we need to understand the URL request lifecycle of Route, Controller, Action, View (RCAV). Let’s recall that Software as a Service (SaaS) has eaten the world. What does this mean? For an application that runs on a server and transmits information across the internet, the interface consists of a set of URLs that a user can visit. People can type in a URL, click a link, or submit a form, and then get back some information relevant and valuable to them. Each URL will either display a page with some information (“get” in HTTP terminology) trigger the storing of some information (“post” in HTTP terminology) trigger the deleting of some information (“delete” in HTTP terminology) trigger the updating of some information (“patch” in HTTP terminology) forward to another URL or some combination of the above Our goal was to demistify what happens between the user action and the return of information. Now we have the vocabulary to talk about this. The world turns around the humble Uniform Resource Locator, or URL. Most obviously, the user might be visiting the URLs in their browser by typing into the address bar or clicking on links. Or, more and more commonly, users might be visiting from native iPhone or Android apps without even knowing that, behind the scenes, they are visiting URLs to store and retrieve the information they need. When somebody puts that URL into the address bar, and something happens between the URL and the page being rendered, we now can say what that is. When a user visits a URL, they are actually triggering a specific Ruby method. But make no mistake: if there is information being stored in a central database, then there’s a web server running somewhere and URLs are being visited with each action a user takes. In the background somewhere, there is an object and method and somebody is saying Something.something, and that method is actually going to do the work of drawing the correct page of information with exactly the right information for that user and outputting it in the right format (almost alway HTML). So our job is to write those Ruby methods (called “actions”) and allow users to trigger those methods when they visit each URL. So we can write any Ruby we want in those action methods. We can generate random numbers, read from APIs, calculate things, send text messages, and more. But every action must do one of two things: Render a response, by sending back some HTML and displaying a new page Redirect, or forward the user onward to another URL. And that’s everything that happens between the user visiting a URL and getting a response, and it is now a complete Route + Controller + Action + Response request lifecycle. We map every URL to one Ruby method that we write in advance and then we wire everything together so that Rails will listen for user visits and when someone visits a particular URL, then Rails will call the method we prepared that will handle getting the database information and wrapping it in bootstrapped markup and sending the HTML to the user’s browser. You can fully specify a web application by listing out the URLs that users can visit, and what happens when each URL is visited. For example, let’s say we wanted to build an interactive game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The complete specifications (or specs, for short) for this app might look like this: http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/rock — Should display “You played rock.”, a random move by the computer, and the outcome. http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/paper — Should display “You played paper.”, a random move by the computer, and the outcome. http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/scissors — Should display “You played scissors.”, a random move by the computer, and the outcome . http://[OUR APP DOMAIN]/ — A welcome page that displays “Happy Monday!” (or whatever day it is). The rules of the game. For example, Happy Tuesday! Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper. Point your browser at /rock, /paper, or /scissors to play the game. Now — how do we get our web server to perform the above tasks when users visit the above URLs? 12.1.1 Text Companion: Dynamic Web Applications and URLs "],["video-segment-route.html", "12.2 Video Segment: Route", " 12.2 Video Segment: Route Notes: all about routing and config/routes.rb get() The key thing is routes. Routes are how to connect a URL to an action. The very important file config/routes.rb contains all of our routes. This is a list of everything our application can do. We’re moving out of our public/ and tasks/ folder, and using more of our Rails application, by working in the app/ folder, where most of our code goes, and with this one file routes.rb that is in the config/ folder. The super important config/routes.rb file included in every Rails app says all the URLs (routes) that a user can visit and when someone visits the URL we say which class and which method Rails should execute to handle the request. Here is an example of a route: # config/routes.rb self.get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) The method here is get5 and there are parentheses for its two arguments: - The first argument to get is a String: the path that we want users to be able to visit (the path is the portion of the URL that comes after the domain name). Here it is \"/rock\" - The second argument to get is a Hash: this is where we tell Rails which method to call when a user visits the path in the first argument. (We’ll have to actually write this method in the next step, after we write the route.) The `Hash` must have two key/value pairs: - `:controller`: The value for this key is what we&#39;re going to name the _class_ that contains the method we want Rails to call when the user visits the path. For now we&#39;re going to default this value to `&quot;application&quot;` — you&#39;ll see why in a minute. - `:action`: The value for this key is the what we&#39;re going to name the method itself. &quot;Action&quot; is the term used to refer to Ruby methods that are triggered by users visiting URLs. - The `Hash` is saying: &quot;Use a `Class` (controller) called `application_controller`, and in that `Class` use a `method` (action) called `play_rock` to generate a response for the user.&quot; Don’t be confused by the key names :controller and :action, these are equivalent to a Ruby Class and method. They just have special names in the lingo of web applications. The get method is inherited, we don’t need to build this method ourselves, which saves us a lot of time. We get the plumbing for free and we just need to tell Rails how we want each request to be handled by declaring our routes. 12.2.1 Text Companion: Route Later we’ll use other methods, post(), etc, if we want to support requests using the other HTTP verbs.↩︎ "],["video-segment-controller-action-view.html", "12.3 Video Segment: Controller, Action, View", " 12.3 Video Segment: Controller, Action, View Notes: all about app/controllers/ ApplicationController inheritance All of our controller classes will be in the app/controllers/ folder. There’s already one controller that comes with every Rails app out-of-the-box: ApplicationController, found in app/controllers/application_controller.rb. This is the controller that the above route is referring to. We will just use this controller for now. Later we will make separate controllers to keep our code organized. An example of an action looks like this: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock self.redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) end end We get the first line class definition for “free”: class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base It comes with Rails. It inherits &lt; from the Base class which is inside the Rails gem, so we would need to go into the Rails gem on GitHub to actually look at it. BENP: gem has maybe not be defined or discussed yet. possible footnote here. Also this is our first time talking about inheritence, so may need some expansion Then we define a method: def play_rock And inside of that we could write whatever steps we want (like calls to GoogleMaps or weather services from DarkSky BENP: I don’t think either of these have been presented at this point in the class). At the end of the day, the job of an action is to send back a response to the user. A response can be either: Rendering some data, in any one of many formats: Plain text. JSON for an application to consume — we’ve seen JSON before (in APIs), and consumed it ourselves with our Ruby scripts. HTML for their browser to draw — we’ll learn this soon. Less commonly, any other format: CSV, PDF, XML, etc. Or, the action can forward the user to another URL. This is known as redirecting. We get a method for each of these two: render for the first, and redirect_to for the second. In this case, we redirect to another URL: self.redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) As you can see, the argument to redirect_to is a String which contains some URL that you want the user to simply be forwarded to. This will come in handy later when, for example, we want to send the user directly back to a list of all photos after they’ve deleted a photo. 12.3.1 Text Companion: Controller, Action, View "],["video-segment-dropping-self..html", "12.4 Video Segment: Dropping self.", " 12.4 Video Segment: Dropping self. Notes: why we drop self. Just to get something out of the way: Usually we always call object.method, and we are using the self keyword above because we are calling these methods on the instance of the class (ApplicationController) that we are defining the method (play_rock) for. Kind of like when we learned about the Person class and there is first_name and last_name, and if we wanted a full_name method we called self.first_name + self.last_name. In this case we’re defining play_rock and we want use the method redirect which already exists on ApplicationController, since it’s inherited via &lt; ActionController::Base. The point is, we are using a method that already exists to build our new method, hence self.redirect_to. In Ruby, when you’re calling a method on self, you can drop the self., and Ruby will figure it out, so we can rewrite the route, controller, action steps to: # config/routes.rb get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) {: mark_lines=“3” } and # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) end end {: mark_lines=“5” } 12.4.1 Text Companion: Dropping .self "],["video-segment-our-first-rcav.html", "12.5 Video Segment: Our First RCAV", " 12.5 Video Segment: Our First RCAV Notes: debugging an RCAV for /rock RTEM ends with redirect_to Our workflow for a dynamic web application is always the same: Route, Controller, Action, View (RCAV). Remember, the world is ruled by URLs. So we will always start with what URL we want to build and get it to work. If we begin by navigating to the route /rock in our Rails browser: http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, then we get an error message: No route matches [GET] “/rock”. We need to Read The Error Message (RTEM) and define the first route that will allow us to support a request of the form for our users. Let’s open the file config/routes.rb and define the route by adding the following code: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“5” } (All of our routes must be contained within the block following Rails.application.routes.draw. A new Rails app will already come with this code pre-written in routes.rb.) Again, we have our route \"/rock\" and our key/value pairs for the :controller (or Class) and :action (or method). We need to choose values for the :controller that Rails will use and the :action within the controller that will be called. For now we are just using the app/controllers/application_controller.rb for the controller, and we will define our action play_rock in there. We now need to open app/controllers/application_controller.rb to add some code. Note that Rails is smart and will add _controller.rb to our :controller argument in get, and within that controller file you will see the class has the underscores removed and is capitalized as ApplicationController. These are helpful conventions, and are best followed. BENP: is that last thing a fair statment? In this file we will add the following: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock end end {: mark_lines=“9-10”} We need our action to exactly match what we wrote in the config/routes.rb file, here play_rock. Between the def play_rock and end that we added, we could put whatever and however much code we would like to execute in that action for the user. In the end we will need to either render some HTML back to the user or redirect the user to another place. Let’s begin by just redirecting to some other URL: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock # write your code here redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) end end {: mark_lines=“10-12”} And we just created a full RCAV request lifecycle. If we go back to the browser and refresh the URL: http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, then we will end up on Wikipedia. If I go back to GitPod and look in my server log (use Cmd + J to open and close the log, Cmd + K to clear the log), then I will see something like: We can see exactly what happened. Someone tried to GET \"/rock\" from a given IP address at a given time, we found a route with instructions to use ApplicationController#play_rock (where the Something#something is Ruby shorthand for Class.method, with the . exchanged for a #), calling this controller-action pair resulted in a redirect to the given URL (https://www.wikipedia.org), and the entire request lifecycle completed in the stated time with no errors. 12.5.1 Text Companion: Our First RCAV "],["video-segment-render-html.html", "12.6 Video Segment: Render HTML", " 12.6 Video Segment: Render HTML Notes: from render({ :plain =&gt; \"Hello, world!\" }) to render({ :template =&gt; \"game_templates/user_rock.html.erb\" }) .html vs. .html.erb app/views/ view templates rather than public/ We’ve written our first functional action, which just forwards someone to a new page. Now let’s try to render some of our own HTML, rather than redirecting to Wikipedia. We can change the previous code in app/controllers/application_controller.rb to: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) render({ :plain =&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“12-14”} Rather than using redirect_to(), which we inherited &lt; from the Rails Base class, we’ll use another inherited method to complete the request lifecycle: render(). This method, takes a Hash as an argument with a key/value pair. The key has many options, here we will use :plain, which will just send back plain text. A boring response, but good to start with. Now if I pretend I’m a user and visit http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, then I get a page with my \"Hello, world!\" rendered. Congratulations! You’ve wired up a route; prepare to do it a million more times, because all developers do all day is pick the next spec , wire up the route for the URL so that a user can visit it, and then implement the logic to send back the correct information. Remember, we did not create and send a file, we are using Ruby to generate this reponse, opening a world of possibilities. For instance, what if we instead rendered a random number: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) render({ :plain =&gt; rand(100) }) end end {: mark_lines=“14”} Now everytime we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, we get a different random number, generated automatically by Ruby. This is a dynamic response, not just a static page that we placed in the public folder. This is a simple example, but fundamentally that’s it. We connected a URL to a method that can do anything. It can call APIs, parse CSVs, compute whatever you want, run machine learning models. With this we can do anything. Of course, there is a lot more to learn, but fundamentally this is it. Now let’s send back some actual HTML: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) end end {: mark_lines=“14”} The :html key to render() allows us to place whatever HTML we want in a string that will be shown on the page. We need the .html_safe on the end of the string, which is a bit of Rails security to make sure that one user can’t inject malicious HTML into another user’s browser, in case we were getting the given HTML string from another user (e.g., from a &lt;form&gt;). Don’t worry about this, we will see a better way of doing this in a moment. If we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, then we will see our HTML. We could go crazy and put our entire HTML document in that string. But a much, much better way to to write what’s called an embedded Ruby template. # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) # render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“16”} The :template key to render() allows us to assign a template to render. We specify the name of a folder game_templates/ and file user_rock.html.erb that will contain all of our HTML. This is an .erb for embedded Ruby template file, rather than a plain old .html file. We create this file in the existing app/views/ folder, which is a way better place than public/, because users do not have access to all of its contents. We will keep things organized and put different templates in different sub-folders. Do not put the .html.erb file in the app/views/layouts/ folder that already exists, first make a new folder in app/views/ called game_templates/ then make the new file in this folder called user_rock.html.erb. BENP: insert image(s) (gifs? would be better here; cf. video 00:25:20) of new folder and new file steps in GitPod You can call the game_templates/user_rock.html.erb folder and file whatever you want. The user will not see the folder or the file, they will only see \"/rock\", the specified route. Now you can enter in your new user_rock.html.erb file some HTML to render: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; Don’t forget to save the file changes if you haven’t done so. And now when we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock, we get the text from our file rendered in HTML. So after all of that we have an HTML page that basically does what we could have done quickly if we made a file called rock.html in the public/ folder. 12.6.1 Text Companion: Render HTML "],["video-segment-embedded-ruby-tags.html", "12.7 Video Segment: Embedded Ruby Tags", " 12.7 Video Segment: Embedded Ruby Tags Notes: all about &lt;% %&gt; and &lt;%= %&gt; in a view template But we can do something way better with this new system. Let’s add the following to our embedded Ruby file: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“5-7”} Now we created a new tag that looks like HTML, but contains a doorway to Ruby: &lt;%= %&gt;. We can write any Ruby we want in that embedded Ruby tag, and this is what makes the whole effort of RCAV worthwhile. For instance we can write: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= 6 * 7 %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“6”} And we will see the result of this computation when we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock. But if we go to view source in the browser, we won’t see the Ruby code. We only see the result 42. The browser only understands HTML and has no idea of the code that allows us to make the web application dynamic. So rails is processing all of the embedded Ruby tags and injecting them in the document before it sends the plain HTML file to the browser. We could also do something like &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample %&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= 6 * 7 %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“5”} Here, we used a slightly different embedded Ruby tag: &lt;% %&gt;. We left off the = sign, which means the output of this Ruby code will be hidden in the final HTML. But, the variable comp_move (which is the result of randomly sampling an array of three possble string values) is still available and we can render it by changing the file again: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample %&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“8”} Such that our calculated variable comp_move is now rendered in the final HTML output, because it is in a &lt;%= %&gt; tag, with the = sign. And we will see the result of this computation when we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/rock. View the source code here and you won’t see any sign of the comp_move variable computation from the &lt;% %&gt; tag. BENP: Now could be time for a screenshot or better GIF of refreshing /rock a couple of times to see the output and showing the source code. Alright, we are now finally building dynamic web applications. We are able to render a template, we are able to write some HTML, and we able use embedded Ruby tags: &lt;% %&gt; for hidden content, and &lt;%= %&gt; for rendered content that the user will see. 12.7.1 Text Companion: Embedded Ruby Tags "],["video-segment-control-flow-with-embedded-ruby.html", "12.8 Video Segment: Control Flow with Embedded Ruby", " 12.8 Video Segment: Control Flow with Embedded Ruby Notes: conditionals all about &lt;% if ... %&gt; Now we can actually compute who won or lost our Rock Paper Scissors match.

In the old days, we would create a file in public/ called index.html, but now we are pretty much done with public/ except maybe for static assets like images or css files, but we won’t put any more user-facing URL pages there. Those will be connected up with routes from here on. Let’s go to our config/routes.rb and add a homepage route: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;homepage&quot; }) get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“5” } We are adding the \"/\" homepage route, we are using the application_controller.rb file, and we are using the action (or the method within the ApplicationController) that we call homepage. Now if I refresh the http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/ page, I get an error message that the homepage action cannot be found in ApplicationController: The action &#39;play_rock&#39; could not be found for ApplicationController This is good! That means we defined the route correctly. If you still see a “No route matches” error, then double-check your route syntax and get that error to go away before you proceed further. The error occurs because we did not yet define the action. So we need to go to our app/controllers/application_controller.rb file and add: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def homepage render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/rules.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) # render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“9-11”} And now we can create that new file game_templates/rules.html.erb, and add to it: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/rules.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to RPS&lt;/h1&gt; Now when we refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/, there is no error and our HTML template is rendered. And we did not put any HTML in the public folder! You will almost always want some kind of dynamic behavior on every page. So our new workflow is always RCAV: Define a route, assign a controller, create an action in that controller, and view the result. 12.9.1 Text Companion: Homepage "],["video-segment-reinforce-rcav-with-paper.html", "12.10 Video Segment: Reinforce RCAV with /paper", " 12.10 Video Segment: Reinforce RCAV with /paper Notes: RCAV with render for /paper Let’s start with the /paper route, for when we play paper. First we define the route in config/routes.rb with a controller: # config/routes.rb Rails.application.routes.draw do get(&quot;/&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;homepage&quot; }) get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) get(&quot;/paper&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;application&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_paper&quot; }) end {: mark_lines=“9” } Again, we use the application_controller.rb. If we pretend we are a user now and go to http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/paper, we again get the “action not found” error. The helpful error message (RTEM!) tells us we need to define another method for the action in our controller called play_paper. We are in our Route, Controller, Action, View sequence that makes Rails so useful! It’s the same flow, over and over again. All we need to do is keep visiting the route and RTEM to find the next step. Ok, let’s define the action in our app/controllers/application_controller.rb: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def homepage render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/rules.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) # render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_paper render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_paper.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“23-26”} Now we can pretend we are a user and again refresh http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/paper. And we’ll get a new error message that tells us we are missing the view template: If you cannot figure out what your typo is and why an error message keeps coming up, then delete what you wrote and try to type it again from scratch (or talk to your rubber duck). We RTEM above and that tells us to go and make the new game_templates/user_paper.html.erb file that will be rendered to the user: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_paper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We played paper! &lt;/h2&gt; And now our view at http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/paper renders content with no error message. A successful RCAV! 12.10.1 Text Companion: Reinforce RCAV with /paper "],["video-segment-embedded-ruby-in-the-controller-with-instance-variables.html", "12.11 Video Segment: Embedded Ruby in the Controller with Instance Variables", " 12.11 Video Segment: Embedded Ruby in the Controller with Instance Variables Notes: moving conditional control flow &lt;% if ... %&gt; from /rock into the ApplicationController action play_rock local variables vs. instance variables with @-notation Now that we are RCAV pros, let me show you another (perhaps better, depending on your taste) way of writing our embedded Ruby code. Let’s return to the game_templates/user_rock.html.erb file: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_rock.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We played rock!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample %&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% if comp_move == &quot;rock&quot; %&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We tied!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% elsif comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; %&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We lost!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% elsif comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; %&gt; &lt;h2&gt;We won!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; {: mark_lines=“5”} The highlighted code &lt;% comp_move = [\"rock\", \"paper\", \"scissors\"].sample %&gt; is okay, but you could imagine that in a real application there may be dozens of lines of code to prepare the information that we actually want to show the user. Our example is trivial. In reality we may lookup data from a database, doing math on it, finding API data, and more. Think of our “take your umbrella” example BENP: insert link to this DarkSky API example; but wait, has it even been presented up to this point?, which took around 30 lines of Ruby code to produce. We want somewhere other than the HTML template to put this code. We can in fact do that! Let’s go back to the game_templates/user_paper.html.erb file, since we didn’t get as far there and see how we can make this modification. We would like our file to look like this: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_paper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We played paper! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We &lt;%= outcome %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“7-13”} We wish we could just do this and avoid all the lines of embedded Ruby that are in the previous user_rock.html.erb view template. The responsibility for these computations really don’t belong here, the view templates should be given some data and then the job should just be to format and present it beautifuly and usably to the user. In the backend the responsibility should be marshalling the correct data and sending it to the view template. We can return to our app/controllers/application_controller.rb controller file and do the following: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def homepage render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/rules.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) # render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_paper comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample if comp_move == &quot;rock&quot; outcome = &quot;won&quot; elsif comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; outcome = &quot;tied&quot; elsif comp_move == &quot;scissors&quot; outcome = &quot;lost&quot; end render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_paper.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“23-31”} In the above highlighted code we have removed all of the embedded Ruby tags (&lt;% %&gt; and &lt;%= %&gt;) from the code we had in the .html.erb view template. Now when a user visits the route http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/paper, the action play_paper in the controller ApplicationController will be triggered, and the code will be run before the template is rendered. So let’s try to visit http://[YOUR APP DOMAIN]/paper again. Oops, we get this error: In our game_templates/user_paper.html.erb view template, when we get to the first embedded Ruby tag: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_paper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We played paper! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We &lt;%= outcome %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“8”} That local variable comp_move is undefined! A local variable only exists in the scope it was defined. If I create a local variable in a loop, it will only exist in that loop. If I want some variable available outside the loop, then I would need to create it outside the loop and modify it in the loop. So there’s a scope to local variables and I can’t just use it in my template if I created it in the play_paper method (action). The variable is effectively “dead” after play_paper executes. So how do we make the controller variables available in the view template? Let’s modify our app/controllers/application_controller.rb: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(false) # Add your actions below this line # ================================ def homepage render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/rules.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_rock # write your code here # redirect_to(&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;) # render({ :html =&gt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hellow, world!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;.html_safe }) render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot; }) end def play_paper @comp_move = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;].sample if @comp_move == &quot;rock&quot; @outcome = &quot;won&quot; elsif @comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; @outcome = &quot;tied&quot; elsif @comp_move == &quot;scissors&quot; @outcome = &quot;lost&quot; end render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_paper.html.erb&quot; }) end end {: mark_lines=“23 25-30”} All we did was place an @ symbol before any variable that we want access to in our view template. This is a new kind of variable called an instance variable. This type of variable will survive as long as the instance the object in which its created survives BENP: last sentence a bit confusing. In this case when someone visits /paper, Rails is going to create an instance of the ApplicationController class and then run the play_paper method. So as long as the ApplicationController instance is alive (Rails keeps it until the response is sent to the user), the variables produced by play_paper will exist. When someone visits /paper, we now have @comp_move and @outcome available for our template. We just need to make sure those instance variables are also properly referenced in game_templates/user_paper.html.erb: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_paper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We played paper! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= @comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We &lt;%= @outcome %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“8 12”} Again, we just use the leading @ symbols on our variables to tie them to the instance variables in the controller. And if we visit the /paper URL, it works! And we have a much improved organization. Most computation work like this should go in the controller as we have done it here. We will have cases where embedded Ruby goes in the template (e.g., rendering database records with each loops, if statements to check if a user is allowed to see something, other conditional statements). If it can happen in the controller, it should happen there. Time for a rails grade and a /git commit! 12.11.1 Text Companion: Embedded Ruby in the Controller with Instance Variables "],["video-segment-linking-pages-with-layouts.html", "12.12 Video Segment: Linking Pages with Layouts", " 12.12 Video Segment: Linking Pages with Layouts Notes: all about app/views/layouts/wrapper.html.erb to get some headers, footers, and navigation links layout(\"wrapper.html.erb\") in ApplicationController :layout argument for render() It would now be nice to add some links so we don’t need to type in the URL addresses, like in our target{:target=\"_blank\"}. Let’s start with our game_templates/user_paper.html.erb: &lt;!-- app/views/game_templates/user_paper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/rock&quot;&gt;Play Rock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/paper&quot;&gt;Play Paper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We played paper! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; They played &lt;%= @comp_move %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt; We &lt;%= @outcome %&gt;! &lt;/h2&gt; {: mark_lines=“3-8”} And now if we visit our /paper URL, then we have the links. But if we click on “Play Rock” here, and we are taken to the /rock URL, then the links are not there, because we only put them in the game_templates/user_paper.html.erb file, and not in the game_templates/user_rock.html.erb file, which is what visiting the /rock URL will render. BENP: In the below example, we use the app/views/layouts/wrapper.html.erb file that we create, but in all other class work we use app/views/layouts/application.html.erb to place our headers and footers. Maybe we change the below section to just do it with that, which also I think allows us to omit the layout(\"wrapper.html.erb)\" call? How can we avoid repeating these HTML navigation links in all of our view templates? Well, here is one of the great benefits of working in Rails instead of HTML. We are dynamically generating responses rather than hard-coding into a bunch of files. If there is common stuff we want on every page, like a nav-bar or footer, then we can make a special file in app/views/layouts/ and call it whatever we like. Let’s create a file in that folder called wrapper.html.erb and let’s fill our new app/views/layouts/wrapper.html.erb file with: &lt;!-- app/view/layouts/wrapper.html.erb --&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/rock&quot;&gt;Play Rock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/paper&quot;&gt;Play Paper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/scissors&quot;&gt;Play Scissors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;%= yield %&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Copyright, Appdev 2022. All rights reserved. {: mark_lines=“13”} Now every page that we visit will have all of its contents placed where the above highlighted code says &lt;%= yield %&gt;. We just need to also change our application_controller.rb file to note this and have it take effect: # app/controllers/application_controller.rb class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base layout(&quot;wrapper.html.erb&quot;) {: mark_lines=“4”} This layout method takes one argument and it already knows to look in the folder app/views/layouts/ for the file that we created. After this change, try visiting your pages using the links on every page. It should work (except for /scissors because we haven’t done the RCAV for that page yet). If we only wanted the layout to apply on a per-page basis we could also leave layout(false) in the previous code, and we could in the play_rock method (action) change our render statement to: render({ :template =&gt; &quot;game_templates/user_rock.html.erb&quot;, :layout =&gt; &quot;wrapper.html.erb&quot; }) This additional :layout argument would then only put the nav-bar and footer in wrapper.html.erb on the /rock route.

Rather than rendering a pre-defined message in plain text, it’s usually more helpful to the iPhone developer to render the data in JSON format, so that they can parse it, easily fetch whichever values they need, and assemble their own interface. Here is some JSON that would be convenient for an external application to parse: { &quot;player_move&quot;:&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;comp_move&quot;:&quot;paper&quot;, &quot;outcome&quot;:&quot;lost&quot; } Notice that JSON uses strings as keys — this is because JavaScript doesn’t have the equivalent of Ruby’s Symbol class. Also, there are no hash rockets; JSON just uses colons to separate keys and values. Fortunately, just as it was easy for us to convert a String containing JSON into Ruby Arrays/Hashes using the JSON.parse method, it is also easy for us to go in the other direction: both Array and Hash have methods called .to_json. Let’s create a Ruby Hash that resembles the JSON above: response_hash = { :player_move =&gt; &quot;rock&quot;, :comp_move =&gt; &quot;paper&quot;, :outcome =&gt; &quot;lost&quot; } We can then convert this into a String in JSON format with .to_json: response_hash.to_json returns: &quot;{\\&quot;player_move\\&quot;:\\&quot;rock\\&quot;,\\&quot;comp_move\\&quot;:\\&quot;paper\\&quot;,\\&quot;outcome\\&quot;:\\&quot;lost\\&quot;}&quot; The \\\" represents double-quotes; we need the backslash, known as an “escape”, because we’re already within a double-quoted string and don’t want to terminate it. You can puts the string to see it formatted: puts response_hash.to_json displays: {&quot;player_move&quot;:&quot;rock&quot;,&quot;comp_move&quot;:&quot;paper&quot;,&quot;outcome&quot;:&quot;lost&quot;} Great! That means we can update our action if we want to send back JSON instead: class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base def play_rock moves = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;] comp_move = moves.sample if comp_move == &quot;rock&quot; outcome = &quot;tied&quot; elsif comp_move == &quot;paper&quot; outcome = &quot;lost&quot; elsif comp_move == &quot;scissors&quot; outcome = &quot;won&quot; end response_hash = { :player_move =&gt; &quot;rock&quot;, :comp_move =&gt; &quot;paper&quot;, :outcome =&gt; &quot;lost&quot; } render({ :plain =&gt; response_hash.to_json }) end end Congratulations — you just built your first API endpoint!  12.14.2 Addendum: Custom Controller Files We don’t have to put all of our actions within the default ApplicationController file that comes included with any Rails app; we can add our own controllers, if we want to organize things a bit more. With an app of any non-trivial size, you’ll end up with hundreds of actions, and it can get unwieldy to put them all in one gigantic application_controller.rb. Instead, we can change our route for /rock to this: get(&quot;/rock&quot;, { :controller =&gt; &quot;game&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;play_rock&quot; }) Now when a user visits /rock, they will see an error uninitialized constant GameController. As we know, when Ruby says “uninitialized constant” it means “I can’t find that class”. So, what’s going on here? When we said :controller =&gt; \"game\" in the route, we told Rails to look for a class called GameController when someone visits /rock. All of the controller class names will end in ...Controller, and they will begin with whatever value we provided for the key :controller in the route. Like all Ruby classes, the name must be CamelCase (not snake_case or Some_Hybrid). So in this case, it will be GameController. The class must be defined in a Ruby file that is the snake_cased version of its name. Rails will itself use the .underscore method to figure out the name; we can try it ourselves in rails console: [2] pry(main)&gt; &quot;GameController&quot;.underscore =&gt; &quot;game_controller&quot; The Ruby file must be placed within the app/controllers/ folder. So, in this case, we create a file called app/controllers/game_controller.rb (don’t forget the .rb file extension). Finally, within this file, we define the class: class GameController &lt; ApplicationController end We inherit from ApplicationController, which in turn inherits from ActionController::Base; much like our models inherited from ActiveRecord::Base via ApplicationRecord. Our models inherited .save, .where, and a bunch of other awesome database-related methods from ActiveRecord::Base; whereas our controllers are going to inherit a bunch of methods like render, redirect_to, and a bunch of other awesome interface-related methods from ActionController::Base. Don’t forget the end that goes with the class; type it before you forget it. Move your play_rock action over from application_controller.rb into this new class. Now, when a user visits the path /rock, the “uninitialized constant” error should go away and you should see a response as before. If you still see the “unitialized constant” error, then: You named your class wrong; it must exactly match the value in routes.rb, followed by Controller (singular), and CamelCase. You named the file wrong. Try doing .underscore on a string containing the class name in rails console to figure out the correct filename. You put the file in the wrong folder. It has to be within app/controllers/. Not within, for example, app/ or app/controllers/concerns/. You forgot the .rb file extension. If you can’t find which of the above it is, try deleting what you did and paving over your work again from scratch. Sometimes you just can’t spot your own typos, and paving over is the best approach. You can make as many controllers as you like; in general, a rule of thumb is to have one controller per database table.
