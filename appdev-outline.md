# AppDev Outline

This document is a chronological outline of the AppDev course content, based on the Canvas material for "BUSN 36110 81 (Summer 2022) Application Development". 

## Diátaxis

In an effort towards [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/), the content is identified by small chunks of material and tags are used in the section headers. **We should strive to keep these all separated**.

  1. (da="Tutorial")
      - *pratical-study quadrant*
      - practical guided tutorials that produce meaningful results
      - avoid abstraction, generalization, explanation, choices

  1. (da="HowTo")
      - *pratical-work quadrant*
      - similar to tutorial, but more concise with no digression or teaching

  1. (da="Explain")
      - *theoretical-study quadrant*
      - understanding-oriented discussions referring to big-picture topics
      - include concepts, connections, abstraction, generalzation, alternatives, optional readings
  
  1. (da="TechRef")
      - *theoretical-work quadrant*
      - indexes, glossaries, dictionaries
      - pure information, concise, no ambiguity, provide examples

  1. (da="Exercise")
      - *our own*
      - this is not part of the cannon, but we add it

One could argue that "Exercises" are an offshoot of "Tutorials". But I keep them separated for now.

Note, the difference between "Tutorials" and "HowTo" [here](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials-how-to/#whats-the-difference-between-a-tutorial-and-how-to-guide). Both describe a sequence of actions and are done hands-on. They are distinguished by the user needs: *study* ("Tutorial") vs. *work* ("HowTo"). Tutorials provide a learning experience, how-to-guides help the user accomplish a task. 

For us, the line is blurry, but a breakdown could be that any **gitpod and other videos are "Tutorials"** and the **written accompaniment is a "HowTo"**. How-to-guides should never be videos, because a user should be able to quickly refer to what they need, without buffering or scrubbing.


## The structure

The outline is ordered with heading levels like so:

  - \# Week
    - \## Topic
      - \### Video Segment (tutorial or explanation)
        - \#### Text Companion (how-to if tutorial, otherwise written explanation, always *concise*)

Exercises are also peppered into the structure. See next section for technical references.

## Technical References: Code vs. Terminology

There are two types of technical references. One is for terms, the **terminology reference**, which can be related to specific programming languages, however, any examples of HTML tags, Ruby methods, etc. should go into the **code reference**. There is one code reference for each subject area: *HTML*, *CSS*, *Ruby*, etc.

Both of these glossaries could be built up through the class, meaning the students would only see the most recent terms and those introduced previously. By the end, this is a long glossary sectioned by course units.

These code references already exist:
  
  - Ruby:
    - [Ruby Foundations Slides](https://firstdraft.slides.com/raghubetina/05-ruby-foundations?token=SFyjvCyP)
    - `the-one-reference.md`
    - `optional-syntaxes-in-ruby.rb`

  - HTML + CSS:  
    - [HTML + CSS Recap Slides](https://firstdraft.slides.com/raghubetina/html-and-css-recap?token=8gU8ghvw)
    - `html-reference.md`
    - `html-cheatsheet.md`
    - `classbook.md`
